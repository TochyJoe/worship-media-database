Title: YOU LORD ARE HOLY


Verse 1
You Lord ARE HOLY
Lord YOU’RE HOLY

AND WE LIFT You UP AND  MAGNIFY Your NAME&#11
AS I LOOK AROUND AND I SEE ALL  THE WORKS

THAT Your HANDS HAVE MADE,  THE AWESOMENESS OF You

Verse 2
AND HOW Your LOVE WILL NEVER  FADE
MERE WORDS CANNOT EXPRESS  WHAT I FEEL INSIDE

I CAN’T DESCRIBE Your GLORY  DIVINE
BUT AS A TOKEN OF MY LOVE THIS  IS WHAT I’LL DO

(I’LL LIFT HANDS AND CRY, Lord  You ARE HOLY)

Verse 3
THERE IS NOT ENOUGH WORDS  THAT I CAN SAY
TO TELL You HOW MUCH I  APPRECIATE

ALL THE WONDERFUL THINGS  YOU’VE GIVEN ME
Your LOVING KINDNESS

Verse 4
Your TENDER MERCIES
IT IS MY DESIRE TO PRAISE

YOU, AND TELL You HOW MUCH I  LOVE You
YOU’RE WORTHY OF ALL THE  HONOR

Lord YOU’RE WORTHY OF ALL THE  PRAISE

Verse 5
I DON’T KNOW HOW You COULD  LOVE ME
HOW You COULD GIVE ME SO  MUCH MERCY

You DIDN’T HAVE TO SUFFER AND  DIE FOR ME
WAY BACK ON CALVARY

BUT I JUST WANT TO THANK You
I THANK You
