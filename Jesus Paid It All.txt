Title: Jesus Paid It All


Chorus 1
Jesus paid it all, all to Him I owe
Sin had left a crimson stain

He washed it white as snow

Verse 1
I hear the Savior say
"Thy strength indeed is small

Child of weakness watch and pray
Find in Me thine all in all."

Verse 2
Lord, now indeed I find
Thy power and Thine alone

Can change the leper's spots
And melt the heart of stone

Verse 3
For nothing good have I
Whereby Thy grace to claim

I'll wash my garments white
In the blood of Calvary's Lamb

Verse 4
And when before the throne
I stand in Him complete

"Jesus died my soul to save,"
My lips shall still repeat
