Title: IT'S A NEW SEASON


Chorus 1
It's a new season, it's a new day
A fresh anointing is flowing my way

It's a season of power and prosperity
It's a new season coming to me

Verse 1
The devil's time is up no longer
Can he bother me

Cause the Creator of the
Universe He fathers me

And it's transferable my
Children's children shall be free

It's a new season (it's a new season)

If You don't know by now
You need to know it's jubilee

Where debts are cancel and
Your children walk in victory

It's so available to You right
Now just taste and see

It's a new season
(it's a new season)

Verse 2
The new millennium presents a new horizon
And no greater time for us to make a choice and take a stand

All that we need, is resting in His hands
It's a new season (it's a new season)

All that was stolen is returned to You a hundred fold
Tried in the fire but you're coming out gold

Cling to His hand
Yes, to every promise take a hold

It's a new season (it's a new season)
