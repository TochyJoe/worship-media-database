Title: Go Tell It On the Mountain


Chorus 1
Go tell it on the mountain
Over the hills and everywhere

Go tell it on the mountain
That Jesus Christ is born

Verse 1
Down in a lowly manger
The humble Christ was born

And brought us God's salvation
That blessed Christmas morn

Verse 2
When I was a seeker
I sought both night and day

I asked the Lord to help me
And He showed me the way

Verse 3
He made me a watchman
Upon the city wall

And if I am a Christian
I am the least of all

Verse 4
While shepherds kept their watching
O'er silent flocks by night

Behold throughout the heavens
There shone a holy light

Verse 5
And lo, when they had seen it
They all bowed down and prayed

They traveled on together
To where the Babe was laid

Verse 6
The shepherds feared and trembled
When lo above the earth

Rang out the angel chorus
That hailed our Savior's birth

Verse 7
When I was a sinner
I prayed both night and day

I asked the Lord to help me
And He showed me the way
