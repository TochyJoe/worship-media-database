Title: For You Are God Alone


For You are God alone
From before time begin

You are on Your throne
You are God alone

And right now in the good times and bad
You are on Your Throne

You are God alone

Hallelujah, You have won the victory
Hallelujah, You have won it all for me

Death could not hold You down
You are the risen King

You're seated in majesty

Lord You are the risen King

Hallelujah,You have won the victory
Hallelujah, You have won it all for me

Hallelujah,You have won the victory
Hallelujah, You have won it all for me

Death could not hold You down
You are the risen King

Seated in majesty

You are the risen King

There's nobody like Jehovah
Hallelujah,You have won the victory

Hallelujah, You have won it all for me

Death could not hold You down
Death could not hold You down

Death could not hold You down
Death could not hold You down

You are the risen King
You're seated in majesty

You are the risen King

You are on Your throne and right now from the good time  and bad You are God alone

Hallelujah, You have won the victory
Hallelujah, You have won it all for me
