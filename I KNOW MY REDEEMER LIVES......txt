Title: I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES.....


Who taught the sun
Where to stand in the morning

And who told the ocean
You can only come this far

And who showed the moon
Where to hide till evening

Whose words alone can
Catch a falling star

WELL I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES
I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES

ALL OF CREATION TESTIFIES
THIS LIFE WITHIN ME CRIES

I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES

The very same God
That spins things in orbit

Runs to the weary
The worn and the weak

And the same gentle hands
That hold me when I'm broken

They conquer death to bring me victory

YE-E-EAH
THE VERY SAME God

THAT SPINS THINGS IN ORBIT
RUNS TO THE WEARY, THE WORN AND THE WEAK

AND THE SAME GENTLE HANDS THAT HOLD ME WHEN I'M BROKEN
THEY CONQUERED DEATH TO BRING ME VICTORY

NOW I KNOW, MY REDEEMER LIVES
I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES

LET ALL CREATION TESTIFY
LET THIS LIFE WITHIN ME CRY

I-I-I KNOW
MY REDEEMER

HE LIVES
TO TAKE AWAY MY SHAME

AND HE LIVES
FOREVER I'LL PROCLAIM

THAT THE PAYMENT FOR MY SINS
WAS THE PRECIOUS LIFE HE GAVE

BUT NOW HE'S ALIVE AND
THERE'S AN EMPTY

GRAVE!

AND I KNOW
MY REDEEMER LIVES

HE LIVES
I KNOW

MY REDEEMER LIVES
LET ALL CREATION TESTIFY

LET THIS LIFE WITHIN ME CRY
I-I-I KNOW MY REDEEMER

I KNOW
MY REDEEMER LIVES

I KNOW MY REDEEMER LIVES

I KNOW, THAT I KNOW, THAT I KNOW, THAT I KNOW, THAT I KNOW
HE LIVES

MY REDEEMER LIVES
BECAUSE HE LIVES I CAN FACE TOMORROW

HE LIVES

I KNOW, I KNOW
HE LIVES

I SPOKE WITH HIM THIS MORNING!
HE LIVES

THE TOMB IS EMPTY
HE LIVES

HE LIVES! I'M GOING TO TELL EVERYBODY!!
