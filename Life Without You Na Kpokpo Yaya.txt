Life without You na kpokpo yaya

You are mor than capable, incredible, You

Make me wonder
Something about You

Ama ama amasi amasi
All things are possible,

Unstoppbale when

You dey my side
Even in the midnight hour

You with me no

Yawa
Na You be my odobgu na aha

Chorus 1
Na Your hand I dey

I deyyy, I dey, I dey kampe

Ide ji Mba, na Your hand I dey

Verse 2
Surely there is no need to worry

No matter what the matter maybe

I know You are there for me everyday

You showed me love and made a way

Sometimes I go astray but You still love me

And made a way, You are never far away

Even in the midnight hour, evil still

Spread, no yawa

Na You be my odobgu na aha

Chorus 1
Na Your hand I dey
I deyyy, I dey, I dey kamp

Ide ji Mba, na Your hand I dey

I Dont wanna depend on Mr anymore

Cos I can't do this things on my own

I will learn to rely on You much more

Cos I trust You with my life, na You I Know

Even in the midnight hour, evil still spread, no yawa

You are my odogbu na aha

Chorus 1
Na Your hand I dey

I deyyy, I dey, I dey kampe

Ide ji Mba, na Your hand I dey
