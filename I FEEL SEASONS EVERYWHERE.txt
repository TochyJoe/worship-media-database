Title: I FEEL SEASONS EVERYWHERE


Verse 1
I FEEL SEASONS EVERYWHERE
I FEEL BLESSINGS IN THE AIR

THOSE SEEDS THAT YOU’VE SOWN
YOU’RE GONNA COME INTO Your OWN SEASONS

&#11;WALK INTO Your SEASON

Verse 2
I BELIEVE WE’RE IN A TIME WHEN
GOD’S GONNA BLESS THE SAINTS

THOSE WHO HAVE STAYED
THOSE WHO HAVE PRAYED

HE’S GONNA FULFILL

THE PROMISE HE MADE
FOR I HEAR THE SPIRIT SAY

IT’S Your TIME
THE WAIT IS OVER

WALK INTO Your SEASON

Verse 3
I KNOW THAT YOU’VE INVESTED A LOT
THE RETURN HAS BEEN SLOW

You THROW Your HANDS UP AND SAY I GIVE UP
I JUST CAN’T TAKE IT ANYMORE

BUT I HEAR THE SPIRIT SAY THAT IT’S Your TIME
THE WAITING IS OVER

WALK INTO INTO Your SEASON

Verse 4
You SURVIVED THE WORST OF TIMES
God WAS ALWAYS ON Your SIDE

STATE Your CLAIM
WRITE Your NAME

WALK INTO THIS WEALTHY PLACE
