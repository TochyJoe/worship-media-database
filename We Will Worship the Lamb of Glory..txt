Title: We Will Worship the Lamb of Glory.


We will worship the lamb of glory
We will worship the king of kings

We will worship the lamb of glory
We will worship the king

We bless the name of the lamb of glory
We bless the name of the king of kings

We bless the name of the lamb of glory
We bless the name of the king

And with our hands lifted high
We will worship and sing

And with out hands lifted high
We come before You rejoicing

With our hands lifted high
To the sky and the world wonders why

We'll just tell them we're loving our king

Oh oh oh oh oh
We'll just tell them we're loving our king
