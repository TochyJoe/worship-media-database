Title: INDESCRIBABLE


Verse 1
From the highest of heights to the depths of the sea
Creations revealing Your majesty

From the colors of fall to the fragrance of spring
Every creature unique in the song that it sings

All exclaiming

Chorus 1
Indescribable, uncontainable
You place the stars in the sky and You know them by name

You are amazing God
All powerful, untamable, awestruck we fall to our knees as we humbly  proclaim

You are amazing God

Verse 2
Who sees lightning bolts and tells them where they should go
Or sees heavenly store houses laden with snow

Who imagined the sun and gave source to its light
Yet conceals it to bring us the coolness of night

None can fathom

(Chorus)

Incomparable, unchangeable
You've seen the depths of my heart and You love me the same

You are amazing God
You are amazing God

[Chorus]

You are amazing God
