Title: It Pays To Serve Jesus, I Speak From My Heart,


It pays to serve Jesus, I speak from my heart
He'll always be with us, if we do our part

There's naught in this wide world can pleasure afford
There's peace and contentment in serving the Lord

Chorus 1
I love Him far better than in days of yore
I'll serve Him more truly than ever before

I'll do as He bids me, whatever the cost
I'll be a true soldier, I'll die at my post

And oft when I'm tempted to turn from the track
I think of my Saviour, my mind wanders back

To the place where they nailed Him on Calvary's tree
I heard a voice saying, "I suffered for thee."

A place I remember where I was set free
'Twas where I found pardon, a heaven to me

There Jesus spoke sweetly to my weary soul
My sins were forgiven, He made my heart whole

How rich is the blessing the world cannot give
I'm satisfied fully for Jesus to live

Though friends may forsake me and trial arise
I am trusting Jesus, His love never dies

There is no one like Jesus can cheer me today
His love and His kindness can ne'er fade away

In winter and summer, in sunshine and rain
His love and affection are always the same

Will You have this blessing that Jesus bestows
A free full salvation from sin's bitter throes?

O come to the Saviour, to Calvary flee
The fountain is opened, is flowing for thee
