Title: THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN FINDS A WAY


Times New Roman;  THE ACCUSER OF THE BRETHREN FINDS A WAY
TO COME BEFORE THE HOLY JUDGE OF ALL EARTH

POINTS A FINGER AT THE FAULTS AND FALLINGS OF  THE SAINTS
THEN HE MAKES A CASE, WONT You JUDGE THEM  NOW

BUT WE GOT AN ADVOCATE IIN HEAVENS COURT
MY REDDEMER AND HIGH PRIEST OF MY SOUL

Jesus Christ THE LAMB, THE HOLY LAMB OF God
WHEN HE HEARS THE CASE

OH THIS IS WHAT HE SAYS

I SEE THE BLOOD
MY PRECIOUS BLOOD

I SEE THE BLOOD
ETERNAL SAVING BLOOD

THEY DON'T HAVE TO CRY, I HAVE PAID THE PRICE

EVEN THOUGH MY VICTORY HAS LONG BEEN WON
THE ACCUSER NEVER STOPS SO HARD TO CRY

FIGHTING WITH THE THOUGHTS OF You
JUST SO I CAN DOUBT

WHO I AM IN Christ
THIS IS WHAT I HAVE TO SAY

I PLEAD THE BLOOD

WE OVERCAME HIM BY THE BLOOD
AND BY THE WORD OF MY TESTIMONY

WHEN WE FALL AND WE CONFESS
THE Father IS WILLING TO FORGIVE
