Title: I Can Say That You're Wonderful


I can say that You're wonderful
But it doesn't seem good enough

I can say that You're kind
But that would miss the mark

I can say that You're beautiful
But to me You are so much more

How do I communicate exactly who You are?

I'm trying to convey the sentiment of my heart, and say
I really do appreciate the way You brighten up my day

I can't find the words to describe You
It would take a million years

It would take a million years to explain the way I feel
You are the epitome

You are the epitome of everything I'll ever need
I'm so in awe of You, Lord You leave me speechless

Now if I had more time
I would go down the line

And name all the things that captivate my heart
But clearly I'm not aware of words that can compare

How do I communicate exactly who You are?

I'm trying to convey the sentiment of my heart, and say
I really do appreciate the way You brighten up my day

Oh, I can't find the words to describe You
It would take a million years

It would take a million years to explain the way I feel
Lord You are the epitome, You are the epitome of everything

I'll ever need
I'm so in awe of You, Lord You leave me speechless

Oh, I traveled every corner of my mind, yes I did
And found there's no expression that can define

The way You cared for me throughout the hands of time
I'm searching for a word to say

That You take my breath away

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't find the words to describe You

It would take a million years
It would take a million years to explain the way I feel

You are the epitome of everything I'll ever need
I'm so in awe of You, Lord You leave me speechless

Say Lord You leave me speechless

If I can't say the words
Tell me what You gon' do

And I'll just raise my hand and say
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

I'm so in awe of You
Lord You leave me speechless
