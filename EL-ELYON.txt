Title: EL-ELYON


I Will Sing of The Mercies of The Lord
With My Mouth Shall I make It Known

From the rising of the sun right unto its going down
I will Sing of the mercies of the Lord

I Will Follow
I Will Follow

Will Follow You Till the End of Time

Blessed Be Your Name, Ooo Lord (2ce)
Blessed Be the One, Who Reigns Forever More

Blessed Be Your Name Ooo Lord

Why Do You Call Him LORD, When He doesn’t Know You  (2ce)

Why Do You Call Him LORD, When He doesn’t Know You At  ALL…

Little Little Foxes Spoil the vine
They Take Away Your Rights To History

Stop Your March to Destiny
Little Foxes Always Spoil the Vine

Your Holy Son
No Sin To Hide

But You Have Sent Him From Your Side
To Walk Upon

The Gulty Side And To Become The Lamb of God

Your Gift of Love
They Crucified

They laughed and Scorned
Him As He Died

Ther Humble King
They named As Fraud

And The Sacrificed
The Lamb of God

O Lamb of God

Sweet Lamb of God
I Love the Holy Lamb Of God

Wash Me In Your Precious Blood
My Precious Jesus Christ

Is the Lamb Of God

Zion is Calling Me To A Higher Place of Praise
It Becomes My Highest Praise

When All That I am Responds to Who You Are
To Stand Upon the Mountain

And To Magnify His Name
To Tell All The People

In Every Nation That He Reigns

Zion Is Calling Me, To A Higher Place of Praiseeee
He Becomes My Highest Praise

When All That I am Responds to Who You Are
Just To Know You Lord

You Are Glorious
So Glorious In Your Praise

You Are Powerful

So Powerful In Your Praise
You Are Merciful

So Merciful In Your Praise…

You are Dangerous
So Dangerous in Your Praise…

You are Terrible
So Terrible In Your Praise…

Yahweh ehehhhh
Yahweh ehehhhh…

Out of the ashes of the my dying today
I see a breaking of a brand new day

In which the name of the Lord Alone is glorified

Until the knowledge of the GLORY of the LORD
Takes over the earth

As the waters that covers the sea

Blessed Be Your Name, Ooo Lord (2ce)
Blessed Be the One, Who Reigns Forever More

Blessed Be Your Name Ooo Lord
