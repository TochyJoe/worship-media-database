Title: Jesus My Lord I thee Adore


Jesus, my Lord, my God, my all
Hear me, blest Saviour, when I call

Hear me, and from thy dwelling-place
Pour down the riches of thy grace

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, too late I thee have sought
How can I love thee as I ought?

And how extol thy matchless fame
The glorious beauty of thy name?

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, what didst thou find in me
That thou hast dealt so lovingly?

How great the joy that thou hast brought
So far exceeding hope or thought

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, my Lord, I thee adore
O make me love thee more and more

Jesus, of thee shall be my song
To thee my heart and soul belong

All that I am or have is thine
And thou, sweet Saviour, thou art mine
