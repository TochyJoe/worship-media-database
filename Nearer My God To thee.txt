Title: Nearer My God To thee


Verse 1
Nearer my God to Thee
Nearer to Thee!

E'en though it be a cross that raiseth me

Still all my song would be nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Verse 1
Though like the wanderer, the sun gone down
Darkness be over me, my rest a stone

Yet in my dreams I'd be nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Verse 1
There let the way appear steps unto heav'n
All that Thou sendest me in mercy giv'n

Angels to beckon me nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Verse 1
The with my waking thoughts bright with Thy praise
Out of my stony griefs Bethel I'll raise

So by my woes to be nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!

Verse 1
Or if on joyful wing, cleaving the sky
Sun, moon, and stars forgot, upwards I fly

Still all my song shall be, nearer, my God, to Thee
Nearer, my God, to Thee, nearer to Thee!
