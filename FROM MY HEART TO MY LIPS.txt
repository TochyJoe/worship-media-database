Title: FROM MY HEART TO MY LIPS


FROM MY HEART TO MY LIPS
TO THE EARS OF MY KING

OH LORD! BE GLORIFIED

FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN
TO THE GOING DOWN OF THE SAME

OH LORD! BE GLORIFIED

You ARE GOD, YES You ARE
AND You REIGN IN MAJESTY

ALL TESTIFY THAT You ALONE
ARE God

OH LORD! BE GLORIFIED
