Title: You Alone Deserve the Glory.


You alone deserve the glory
The honor

All of my praise

So I lift my hands to love You
Lord I worship and adore You

No one else deserves the praise
You alone deserves my praise

No one else deserves the praise but You

Verse 2
You alone will I call Holy

You alone will I call worthy

You alone will I call Mighty God

So I lift my hands to love You
Lord I worship and adore You

No one else deserves the praise
You alone deserves my praise

No one else deserves the praise but You

Verse 3
You alone are my Strong Tower

You alone have all the Power

You alone are Savior and Lord

So I lift my hands to love You
Lord I worship and adore You

No one else deserves the praise
You alone deserves my praise

No one else deserves the praise but You

Chorus 1
You are God
You are God

You are God
And God alone

God a-lone
