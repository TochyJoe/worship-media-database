Title: The Name of Our God


Oh oh oh oh oh, no other name
Oh the name of Jesus

Oh oh oh oh oh, no other name
Oh, the name of Jesus

On Christ the solid rock i stand
No other help i know

All other ground is sinking sand
I trust in You alone

Where fear is great our God is greater
We stand unshakeable

In the name
In the name of our God

In the name
In the name of our God

All mountains be moved
Chains now be loosedin the name

In the name of our God

In the name
In the name of our God
