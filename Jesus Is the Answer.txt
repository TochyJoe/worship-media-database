Title: Jesus Is the Answer


Jesus is the answer, for the world today
Above Him there's no other

Jesus is the way.

If You have some questions
In the corners of Your mind

Traces of discouragement
And peace You cannot find

Reflections of Your past
Seem to face You everyday

But there's one thing I want You to know
That Jesus is the way

I know that you've got mountains
That You think You cannot climb

I know Your skies looks so dark
That You think the sun will never ever shine

But in case You don't know it
I tell You God's word is true

Everything that he has promised
I know that he will do it for you
