Title: At Calvary


Chorus 1
Mercy there was great and grace was free
Pardon there was multiplied to me

There my burdened soul found liberty
At Calvary

Verse 1
Years I spent in vanity and pride
Caring not my Lord was crucified

Knowing not it was for me He died
On Calvary

Verse 2
By God's Word at last my sin I learned
Then I trembled at the law I'd spurned

Till my guilty soul imploring turned
To Calvary

Verse 3
Now I've giv'n to Jesus ev'rything
Now I gladly own Him as my King

Now my raptured soul can only sing
Of Calvary

Verse 4
O the love that drew salvation's plan!
O the grace that brought it down to man!

O the mighty gulf that God did span
At Calvary!
