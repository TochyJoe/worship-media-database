Title: Why Should I Feel Discouraged


Verse 1
Why should I feel discouraged
Why should the shadows come

Why should my heart be lonely
And long for Heav'n and home?

When Jesus is my portion
My constant Friend is He:

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He cares for me

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

Verse 1
I sing because I'm happy, (I’m  happy)
I sing because I'm free, (I’m free)

For His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

Verse 1
"Let not Your heart be troubled,"
His tender word I hear

And resting on His goodness
I lose my doubts and fear

Though by the path He leads me
But one step I may see:

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me

Verse 1
Whenever I am tempted
Whenever clouds arise

When songs give place to  sighing
When hope within me dies

I draw the closer to Him
From care He sets me free:

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He cares for me

His eye is on the sparrow
And I know He watches me
