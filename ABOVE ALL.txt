Title: ABOVE ALL


Verse 1
ABOVE ALL POWERS
ABOVE ALL THRONES

ABOVE ALL NATURE
AND ALL CREATED THINGS

ABOVE ALL WISDOM
AND ALL THE WAYS OF MEN

You WERE HERE
BEFORE THE WORLD BEGAN

Verse 1
ABOVE ALL KINGDOMS
ABOVE ALL THRONES

ABOVE ALL WONDERS
THE WORLD HAS EVER KNOWN

ABOVE ALL WEALTH AND TREASURES OF THE EARTH
THERE’S NO WAY TO MEASURE

WHAT You WORTH

Chorus 1
CRUCIFIED
LAID BEHIND THE STONE

You LIVED TO DIE
REJECTED AND ALONE

LIKE A ROSE

TRAMPLED ON THE GROUND
You TOOK THE FALL

AND THOUGHT OF ME
ABOVE ALL
