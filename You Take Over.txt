Title: You Take Over


You take over
I step aside for You to have Your way in me

You take over
I step aside for You to stir me as You

Please
You take over

Am letting go for You to set my heart on

Course
I am yours

I am yours

My spirit soul and body
It all belongs to You

Without You
Without You

There is no me
There is no me

In You I live in You I move oh God
Its You I breathe You ate my life oh God

Chasing after You
All the days of my life I will

You are my joy and passion
In this life

It all belongs

Belongs to You
