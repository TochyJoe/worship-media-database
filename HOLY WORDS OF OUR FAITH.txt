Title: HOLY WORDS OF OUR FAITH


Verse 1
HOLY WORDS OF OUR FAITH
HANDED DOWN TO THIS AGE

CAME TO US THROUGH SACRIFICE
OH HEED THE FAITHFUL WORDS  OF Christ

MARTYRS’ BLOOD
STAINS EACH PAGE

THEY HAVE DIED FOR THIS FAITH
HEAR THEM CRY

THROUGH THE YEARS
HEED THESE WORDS

AND HOLD THEM DEAR

Verse 1
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SONG
THE ANGELS SING

WORTHY IS THE LAMB
SUCH A BEAUTIFUL SOUND

OF LOVE REDEEMED
PRAISES TO THE LAMB 

HALLELUIAH TO THE LAMB
KING OF GLORY

GREAT I AM
SO BEAUTIFUL ARE You

OUR HOLY LAMB
