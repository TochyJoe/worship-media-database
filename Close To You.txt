Title: Close To You


Lord, I love You (How I love You)
More and more each day

I just want to be close, close to You
Under the shadow of Your wings

Please hide me, Lord
So that I might be close, close to You

In Your presence there's fullness of joy
At Your right hand are pleasures  forevermore

No evil can stand where You are
So I just need to be close, close to You
