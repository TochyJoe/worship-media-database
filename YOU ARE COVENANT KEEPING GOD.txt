Title: YOU ARE COVENANT KEEPING GOD


Century Gothic;  You ARE COVENANT KEEPING God
You ARE COVENANT KEEPING GOD…

YAWEH COVENANT KEEPING God
YAWEH COVENANT KEEPING GOD

You NEVER LEAVE ME
You SAID You WON'T FORSAKE ME

You ARE BESIDE ME
THAT IS ALL THAT MATTERS

THE SUN WON’T SMITE ME
AND THE MOON IT WILL NOT HURT ME

THE FLOOD WON’T SWEEP ME
THE Lord IS MY ANCHOR
