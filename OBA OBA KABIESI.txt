Title: OBA OBA KABIESI


If I could sound a thousand voice
It’s not enough to sing Your praise

Mighty One, the great I am

There is no one else like You
You made the ocean deep and wide

You made the sky so beautiful

Only You can do these things
There is no one else like You

OBA AWON OBA KABIESI
ONLY You CAN DO THESE THINGS THERE IS NO ONE ELSE LIKE YOU

ALL THE ANGELS WORSHIP You
