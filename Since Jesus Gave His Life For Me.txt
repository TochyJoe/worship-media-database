Title: Since Jesus Gave His Life For Me


Verse 1
Since Jesus gave His life for me
Should I not give Him mine?

I’m consecrated, Lord, to Thee
I shall be wholly Thine

My life, O Lord, I give to Thee
My talents, time, and all

I’ll serve Thee, Lord, Thine own to be
I’ll hear Thy faintest call

Verse 1
I care not where my Lord directs
His purpose I’ll fulfill

I know He everyone protects
Who does His holy will

Verse 1
Though He may call across the sea
With Jesus I will go

And tell the lost of love so free
Till all His pow’r may know

Verse 1
My home and friends are dear to me
Yet He is dearer still

In my affections first He’ll be
And first His righteous will

Verse 1
My all, O Lord, to Thee I’ll give
Accept it as Thine own

For Thee alone I’ll ever live
My heart shall be Thy throne
