Title: Alagbada Ina


Alagbada Ina
The one who’s clothed with fire

Your voice resounds like thunder
We glorify Your name

Alagbada Ina
The one with eyes of fire

Your name is full of wonders
Come and manifest yourself

You are the Holy one
Dwelling in light so bright

You made the sun and the moon
But You shine brighter than all

As we rejoice and call upon Your name
Please come and take Your place

And manifest yourself

All things are possible
Nothing is hard for You

If we believe in Your name
And we can stand on Your word

These are the days
Of signs and wonders

Days of miracles and power
You will manifest Your self

Mountains will flow down
And darkness will flee

Adversaries surrender

At the sound of Your voice
Fire is burning

Revival is here
The nations will worship

Jesus alone
