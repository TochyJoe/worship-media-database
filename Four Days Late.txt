Title: Four Days Late


The news came to Jesus, please come fast
Lazarus is sick and without Your help he will not last

Mary and Martha, watched their brother die
They waited for Jesus- But He did not come

And they wondered why

The death watch was over; buried four days
Somebody said He'll soon be here

The Lord's on His way
Martha ran to Him, and then she cried

Lord if You had been here- You could have healed him. He'd still be alive

Though You're four days late; and all hope is gone
Lord we don't understand why You've waited so long."

But His way is God's way
Not yours or mine

And isn't it great, when He's four days late- He's still on time!

Verse 2
Jesus said, "Martha, show Me the grave."
But she said, "Lord You don't understand- he's been there four days!""

The grave stone was rolled back
Then Jesus cried, "Lazarus! Come forth!"

Then somebody said, "He's ALIVE! He's ALIVE!"

You may be fighting a battle of fear
You've cried to the Lord "I need You now!" But He has not appeared

Friend don't be discouraged
He's still the same

He'll soon be here, and He'll roll back the stone, and He'll call out Your  name!

When He's four days late and all hope is gone
Lord we don't understand why You've waited so long

But His way is God's way, not yours or mine
And isn't it great when He's four days late- He's still on time!

Oh, my God is great! When He's four days late- He's still on time
