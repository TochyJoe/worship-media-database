Title: You and I Alone


You and I alone
Locked up in Your arms

Is the safest place I wanna be
I wanna be I wanna be

You and I alone
In Your warm embrace

Is the safest place I wanna be
I love to be I'll always be

I wanna be alone with You
Only You Lord

Just to be alone with You
Only You Lord

In You court I come
Sitting at Your feet

I delight myself in You my king
You are the air I breath

I find my joy in You
The essence of my being

Nothing else would matter
When I'm alone with You

I wanna be alone with You
Only You Lord

Just to be alone with You
Only You Lord

Holy is the Lord
