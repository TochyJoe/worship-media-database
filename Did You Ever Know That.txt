Title: Did You Ever Know That


Arial Black;  VERSE
Did You ever know that you're my hero

And everything I would like to be?

Verse 1
I can fly higher than an eagle
'cause You are the wind beneath my  wings

Verse 1
I pray you'll be our eyes
And watch us where we go

And help us to be wise
In times when we don't know

Verse 1
Let this be our prayer
When we lose our way

Lead us to a place
Guide us with Your grace

To a place where we'll be safe

Verse 1
I pray we'll find Your light
And hold it in our hearts

When stars go out each night
Stars go out each night

Remind us where You are

Verse 1
Let this be our prayer
When shadows fill our day

Lead us to a place
Guide us with Your grace

Give us faith so we'll be safe

A world where pain and sorrow will be  ended
And every heart that's broken will be  mended

And we'll remember we are all God's  children

Reaching out to touch You
Reaching to the sky

We ask that life be kind
And watch us from above

We hope each soul will find
Another soul to love

Let this be our prayer
Just like every child

Needs to find a place
Guide us with Your grace

Give us faith so we'll be safe

Verse 1
