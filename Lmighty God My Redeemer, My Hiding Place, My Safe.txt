Title: Lmighty God My Redeemer, My Hiding Place, My Safe


Lmighty God my Redeemer, my hiding place, my safe refuge
No other name like Jesus, no power can stand against You

My feet are planted on this rock and I will not be shaken
My hope it comes from You alone, my Lord and my Salvation

Your praise is always on my lips, Your Word is living in my heart
And I will praise You with a new song, my soul will bless You Lord

You fill my life with greater joy, as I delight myself in You
And I will praise You with a new song, my soul will bless You Lord
