Title: THANK YOU FOR THE CROSS LORD


Verse 1
Thank You for the cross, Lord
Thank You for the price You paid

Bearing all my sin and shame, in love You came
And gave Amazing Grace

Verse 2
Thank You for this love, Lord
Thank You for the nail-pierced hands

Wash me in Your cleansing flow, now all I know
Your forgiveness and embrace

Verse 3
Worthy is the Lamb
Seated on the throne

We crown You now with many crowns
You reign victorious!

High and lifted up
Jesus, Son of God

The darling of Heaven, crucified
Worthy is the Lamb
