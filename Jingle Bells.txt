Title: Jingle Bells


Chorus 1
Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Jingle bells, jingle bells
Jingle all the way

Oh what fun it is to ride
In a one horse open sleigh

Verse 1
Dashing through the snow
In a one horse open sleigh

O'er the fields we go
Laughing all the way

Bells on bobtail ring
Making spirits bright

What fun it is to ride and sing
A sleighing song tonight

Chorus 2
Ring the bells, ring the bells
Ring them out today

Echoing through all the world
Listen what they say

Ring the bells, ring the bells
Ring them all the way

Spread the message far and wide
That Christ is born today
