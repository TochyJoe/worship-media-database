Title: You Lord, You Are Worthy.


You Lord, You are worthy
And no one can worship You for me

For all the things You've done for me
And no one can worship You for me

Here's my worship
All of my worship

Receive my worship
All of my worship

You Lord, You are worthy
And no one can worship You for me

For all the things You've done for me
And no one can worship You for me

Here's my worship
All of my worship

Receive my worship
All of my worship

And I will not be silent
I will always worship You

As long as I am breathing
I will always worship You

Here's my worship
All of my worship

Receive my worship
All of my worship

You Lord, You are worthy
