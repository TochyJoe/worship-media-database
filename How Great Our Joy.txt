How great our joy! Great our joy!

Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

Praise we the Lord in heaven on high!

While by the sheep we watched at night
Glad tidings brought an angel bright

In Bethlehem a Child today

There shall the Child lie in a stall
This Child who shall redeem us all

This gift of God we'll cherish well
That every joy our hearts shall fill
