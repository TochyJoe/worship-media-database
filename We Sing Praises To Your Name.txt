Title: We Sing Praises To Your Name


We sing praises to Your name
Let all the earth proclaim

Your holiness and Your rightousness
Willingly our hands we raise

With our voices, we sing praises unto You
Lord, our Mighty King

Lord of all, Creator of every living thing
For You are the Lord our God Lord of all

Lord of all, You are the Mighty Kings of kings
