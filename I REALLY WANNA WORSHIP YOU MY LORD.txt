Title: I REALLY WANNA WORSHIP YOU MY LORD


Verse 1
You LAID ASIDE Your MAJESTY
GAVE UP EVERYTHING FOR ME

SUFFERED AT THE HANDS
OF THOSE You HAVE CREATED

You TOOK ALL MY GUILT AND SHAME
WHEN You DIED AND ROSE AGAIN

NOW TODAY You REIGN
IN HEAVEN ABOVE EXALTED

Chorus 1
I REALLY WANNA WORSHIP You MY Lord
You HAVE WON MY HEART

AND I AM YOURS
FOREVER AND EVER

I WILL LOVE You

Verse 1
You ARE THE ONLY ONE WHO DIED FOR ME
You GAVE Your LIFE TO SET ME FREE

SO I LIFT MY HANDS TO You IN ADORATION

SO I LIFT MY HANDS TO You IN ADORATION
