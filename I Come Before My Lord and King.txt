Title: I Come Before My Lord and King


I come before my Lord and King
The one who gave His life for me

I'll raise the banner of His name
Until the nations call on Him

The Champion of the hosts above
And captain of my destiny

In You alone I make my boast
You reign alone as Lord of All

We sing as one with heaven's Choir
The Praises of our Saviour King

Emmanuel, Our God with us
Redeemed us all from hell and sin

The Champion of the hosts above
And captain of my destiny

In You alone I make my boast
You reign alone as Lord of All

The Champion of the hosts above
And captain of my destiny

In You alone I make my boast
You reign alone as Lord of All

The Champion of the hosts above
And captain of my destiny

In You alone I make my boast
You reign alone as Lord of All

The Champion of the hosts above
And captain of my destiny

In You alone I make my boast
You reign alone as Lord of All

You reign alone as Lord of All

Amen Amen Amen Hallelujah

Amen Amen Amen Hallelujah
