Title: Jesus, You're the Center of My Joy


Chorus 1
Jesus, You're the center of my joy
All that's good and perfect comes  from You

You're the heart of my contentment
Hope for all I do

Jesus, You're the center of my joy

Verse 1
When I've lost my direction
You're the compass for my way

You're the fire and light
When nights are long and cold

In sadness, You're my laughter
That shatters all my fears

When I'm all alone, Your hand is  there to hold

Verse 2
You are why I find pleasure
In the simple things in life

You're the music in the meadows  and the streams
The voices of the children, my  family, and my home

You're the source and finish of my  highest dreams
