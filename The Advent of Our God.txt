Title: The Advent of Our God


Verse 1
The advent of our God
With eager hearts we greet

And we must praise Him in this hour
With hymns and anthems sweet

Verse 2
All glory to the Son
Who comes to set us free

With Father, Spirit ever One
Through all eternity

Verse 3
The everlasting Son
Incarnate stoops to be

Himself the servant's form
Puts on to set his people free

Verse 4
Come, Zion's daughter
Rise to meet Your lowly King

Nor let Your faithless heart despise
The peace He comes to bring

Verse 5
As judge, on clouds of light
He soon will come again

And all His scattered saints
Unite with Him on high to reign

Verse 6
Before the dawning day
Let sin be put to flight

No longer let the law hold sway
But walk in freedom's light
