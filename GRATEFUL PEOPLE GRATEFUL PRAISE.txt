GRATEFUL PEOPLE GRATEFUL PRAISE

With our hands lifted up, our mouths filled with praise
With hearts overflowing, we gather today

A grateful congregation of saints in praise

We are grateful people, we are grateful people
A grateful congregation of saints in praise

Because we're grateful, because we 're grateful
We give, we give grateful praise

We realize it's an honor to dwell in this place
To bask in the refuge of mercy and grace

They are offering a praise, put a smile on Your face

We are grateful people, we are grateful people
A grateful congregation of saints in praise

Because we 're grateful, because we 're grateful
We give, we give

When I think of the goodness of Jesus and all He's done for me
My very soul cries out Hallelujah

I've got to thank God and praise God
For the great things he's done for me

We are grateful people, we are grateful people
A grateful congregation of saints in praise

Because we 're grateful, we give, we give grateful praise

Because we're blessed, grateful praise
Anybody really grateful?

Yes, I am, really am

Are You the one that's really grateful?
Yes, I am, really am

If you're grateful, clap Your hands
