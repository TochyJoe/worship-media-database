Title: I Am Now A Child of God


I am now a child of God
Have been washed in Jesus blood

Making me an heir of God beyond compare

So while i press along
Daily this shall be my song

I am happy happy happy
Happy millionare

I'm a millionare
I'm a millionare

My Father is rich in houses and lands
And i'm his son

I'm a millionare
I'm a millionare

I am happy happy happy
Happy millionare
