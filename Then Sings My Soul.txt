Title: Then Sings My Soul


Behold the Father's heart
The mystery He lavishes on us

As deep cries out to deep
Oh, how desperately He wants use

The things of earth stand next to Him
Like a candle to the sun

Unfailing Father
What compares to His great love

Behold His holy Son
The Lion and the Lamb given to us

The Word became a man
That my soul should know its Savior

Forsaken for the sake of all mankind
Salvation is in His blood

Jesus Messiah
The righteous died for love

It wasn't over
For He is the risen one

Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul

How great Your love is
How great Your love is

Then sings my soul
Then sings my soul

How great Your love is
How great Your love is

Then sings my soul

Behold I have a friend
The Spirit breathing holy fire within

My ever present help
Speaking truth…
