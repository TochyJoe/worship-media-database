Title: HE IS COMING BACK


To be the one the Lord's calling for in these last and evil days

The one called to be a witness to some souls who's lost their way

Then to be used as His instrument so men may see and know

That He's faithful to His promise, He made long time ago

Chorus 1
He's coming back again
Yes, He's coming back again

Glory hallelujah, bless His name and lift Him up
Praise God, He's coming back again

Verse 2
He told us not worry, but that He had to go away

And while He was away, He would be building us a place
When the time was right, might be morning, noon, or night

He would come back and He's gonna take us there

Chorus 1


Bridge 1
(Jesus Christ is coming back, the Son of man)
(Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, He's the Great I Am)

Coming on the clouds with great pomp and majesty
Praise God, praise God

Hallelujah, hallelujah

Ending
Glory hallelujah

Bless His name and lift Him up
Praise God, He's coming back again

(every day I making preparations)
('cause I'm getting ready for a great celebration)

Praise God, He's coming back again
(I'm keeping my business straight)

('cause tomorrow just might be too late)

Praise God, He's coming back again
