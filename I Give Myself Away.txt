Title: I Give Myself Away


I give myself away
I give myself away

So You can use me

Here I am
Here I stand

Lord, my life is in Your hands
Lord, I'm longing to see

Your desires revealed in me

I give myself away
I give myself away

So You can use me

Take my heart
Take my life

As a living sacrifice
All my dreams all my plans

Lord I place them in Your hands

I give myself away (I give myself away)
I belong…

THIS LIFE IS NOT MY OWN
TO You I BELONG

I GIVE MY SELF
I GIVE MY SELF

TO You
