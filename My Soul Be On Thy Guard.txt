Title: My Soul Be On Thy Guard


Verse 1
My soul be on thy guard
Ten thousand foes arise

The hosts of sin are pressing hard
To draw You from the skies

Verse 2
Oh, watch and fight and pray
The battle ne'er give o'er

Renew it boldly ev'ry day
And help divine implore

Verse 3
Ne'er think the vict'ry won
Nor lay thine armor down

The work of faith will not be done
Till thou obtain the crown

Verse 4
Fight on, my soul, till death
Shall bring thee to thy God

He'll take thee, at thy parting breath
To His divine abode
