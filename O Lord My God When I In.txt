Title: O Lord My God When I In


Verse 1
O Lord my God when I in awesome wonder
Consider all the works Thy hand hath made

I see the stars, I hear the mighty thunder
Thy power throughout the universe displayed

Verse 1
Then sings my soul, my Saviour God to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

Then sings my soul, my Saviour God, to Thee
How great Thou art! How great Thou art!

Verse 1
When through the woods and forest glades I wander
And hear the birds sing sweetly in the trees

When I look down from lofty mountain grandeur
And hear the brook, and feel the gentle breeze

Verse 1
And when I think that God His Son not sparing
Sent Him to die-I scarce can take it in

That on the cross my burden gladly bearing
He bled and died to take away my sin

Verse 1
When Christ shall come with shout of acclamation
And take me home-what joy shall fill my heart!

Then shall I bow in humble adoration
And there proclaim, my God, how great Thou art!
