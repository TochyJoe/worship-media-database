Title: We Three Kings of Orient Are


Chorus 1
O star of wonder, star of night
Star with royal beauty bright

Westward leading, still proceeding
Guide us to Thy perfect light

Verse 1
We three kings of Orient are
Bearing gifts we traverse afar

Field and fountain moor and mountain
Following yonder star

Verse 2
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain
Gold I bring to crown Him again

King forever, ceasing never
Over us all to reign

Verse 3
Frankincense to offer have I
Incense owns a Deity nigh

Prayer and praising, all men raising
Worship Him, God on high

Verse 4
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume
Breathes a life of gathering gloom

Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying
Sealed in the stone cold tomb

Verse 5
Glorious now behold Him arise
King and God and sacrifice

Alleluia, alleluia!
Earth to heav'n replies
