Title: A WHOLE NEW WORLD


Aladdin: I can show You the world
Shining, shimmering, splendid

Tell me, princess, now when did
You last let Your heart decide?

Aladdin: I can open Your eyes
Take You wonder by wonder

Over, sideways and under
On a magic carpet ride

Aladdin: A whole new world
A new fantastic point of view

No one to tell us no or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming

Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
A dazzling place I never knew

But when I'm way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with You

Aladdin: (Now I'm in a whole new world with you)
Princess Jasmine: Unbelievable sights

Indescribable feelings
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling

Through an endless diamond sky

Princess Jasmine: A whole new world
Aladdin: (Don't You dare close Your eyes)

Princess Jasmine: A hundred thousand things to see
Aladdin: (Hold Your breath, it gets better)

Princess Jasmine: I'm like a shooting star
I've come so far

I can't go back
To where I used to be

Aladdin: A whole new world
Princess Jasmine: Every turn a surprise

Aladdin: With new horizons to pursue
Princess Jasmine: Every moment red letter

Both: I'll chase them anywhere
There's time to spare

Let me share this whole new world with You

Aladdin: A whole new world
Princess Jasmine: A whole new world

Aladdin: That's where we'll be
Princess Jasmine: That's where we'll be

Aladdin: A thrilling chase
Princess Jasmine: A wondrous place

Both: For You and me
