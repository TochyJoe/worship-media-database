Title: I'm A Millionaire, I'm A Millionaire


I am now a child of God
I've been wached in Jesus' blood

Making me an heir to wealth beyond compare

So as now I press along
Daily this shall be my song:

"I'm a happy millionaire."

I'm a millionaire
I'm a millionaire

My Father is rich in house and land
Beyond compare

I'm a millionaire
I'm a millionaire

I'm a happy millionaire

Lord, I'd rather worship
Thee with the people who are free

Than the pleasures of this world a season share

I am rich beyond recall
For my Father owns it all

I'm a happy millionaire
