Title: When the Music Fades


Verse 1
When the music fades and all is stripped away
And I simply come longing just to bring

Something that's of worth that will bless Your heart

I'll bring You more than a song for a song in itself
Is not what You have required You search much deeper  within

Through the ways things appear you're looking into my  heart

Verse 1
I'm coming back to the heart of worship
And it's all about You all about You, Jesus

I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made
When it's all about You

It's all about You Jesus

King of endless worth

Verse 1
No one could express how much You deserve
Though I'm weak and poor all I have is Yours

Every single breath, I'll bring You more than a song

For a song in itself is not what You have required
You search much deeper within through the ways things  appear

You're looking into my heart

It's all about You
It's all about You

It's all about You, Jesus
