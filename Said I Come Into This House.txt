Title: Said I Come Into This House


Said I come into this house, without a shout of a doubt
I worship You

I lay aside, every weight, the sin adopted set
I worship You

You are bigger than all the trials
Bigger than all the pains

I bless Your name
Ama… ma…

You are the God of all creations
We stand in one accord

And Exalt Your Name

Verse 2
You my God, my everything
Since You died, You rose again

You are the God of all creations
We honour you, in this congregation

Forever Lord, You will ever be beautiful
Your mercy Lord, they never cease

They are new every morning
Every hour, every day…

Yeah…

You are the Joy and the Air I breath
Through it all, You are there for me

You gave my life a meaning
Oh my God

You are everything I got… oh yeah yeah…

Said it was Your Love
That You sent from up above

To remove the hatred
Because of Your Love…
