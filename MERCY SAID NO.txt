Title: MERCY SAID NO


I was just a child, when I felt the Savior leading
I was drawn to what I could not understand

And for the cause of Christ, I have spent my days believing
That what He'd have me be, is who I am

As I've come to see the weaker side of me
I realize His grace is what I'll need

When sin demanded justice for my soul

Chorus 1
Mercy said no
I'm not gonna let You go

I'm not gonna let You slip away
You don't have to be afraid

Mercy said no
Sin will never ever take control

Life and death stood face to face
Darkness tried to steal my heart away

Thank You Jesus, Mercy said no

For God so loved the world, that He sent His son to save us
From the cross He built a bridge to set us free

Oh, but deep within our hearts, there is still a war that rages
And makes a sacrifice so hard to see

As midnight fell on crucifixion day
The light of hope seemed oh so far away

As evil tried to stop redemption's flow

[Repeat Chorus]

Bridge 1
And now when heaven looks at me
It's through the blood of Jesus

Reminding me of one day long ago

[Repeat Chorus]
