Title: Now I'm Standing In Your Presence


Now I'm standing in Your presence
In the presence of the King

And I hear a multitude of voices
As all creation sings

Now they're watching from the grandstands
These mighty men of old

As the final curtain rises
And redemption's plan unfolds

Chorus 1
Mount Zion!
Heavenly Jerusalem

I can hear the angels singing
On Mount Zion

Heavenly Jerusalem

Like a hundred oceans crashing
Like thunder in the sky

About a billion voices singing
Glory to His Name on high

For the Lord our God, the Almighty
For the Lord God Almighty reigns

Verse 2
To the general assembly
To the church of the first-born

All those registered in heaven
And to God the Judge of all

I see Abraham and Moses
With Jesus, Lord of all

Joining with the angel voices
As they sing the greatest song

Chorus 1
(Welcome to Mount Zi..on)
Mount Zion

Heavenly Jerusalem
(I can hear the angels singing)

(Mount Zion)Mount Zion
Heavenly Jerusalem

(Like a hundred oceans crashing)
(Like thunder in the sky)

(About a billion voices singing)
Glory to His Name on high

For the Lord our God, the Almighty
For the Lord God Almighty reigns

Then I saw a new earth and heaven too
For the former earth and sky had disappeared

Then I saw the holy city
The New Jerusalem

Coming down from God
Out of the heavens
