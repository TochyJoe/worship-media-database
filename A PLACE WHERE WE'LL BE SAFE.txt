Title: A PLACE WHERE WE'LL BE SAFE


Verse 1
I PRAY YOU’LL BE OUR EYES
AND WATCH US WHERE WE GO

AND HELP US TO BE WISE
IN TIMES WHEN WE DON’T KNOW

LET THIS BE OUR PRAYER
WHEN WE LOOSE OUR WAY

LEAD US TO A PLACE
GUIDE US WITH Your GRACE

TO A PLACE WHERE
WE’LL BE SAFE

Verse 1
I PRAY WE’LL FIND Your LIGHT
AND HOLD IT IN OUR HEART

STARS GO OUT EACH NIGHT
REMIND US WHERE You ARE

LET THIS BE OUR PRAYER
WHEN SHADOWS FILL OUR DAY

LEAD US TO A PLACE
GUIDE US WITH Your GRACE

GIVE US FAITH SO WE’LL BE SAFE
