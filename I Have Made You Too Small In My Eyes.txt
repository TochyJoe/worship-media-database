Title: I Have Made You Too Small In My Eyes


Verse 1
I have made You
Too small in my eyes

O Lord forgive me
And I have believed

In a lie that You were
Unable to help me

But now O Lord
I see my wrong

Heal my heart
And show yourself

Strong
And in my life and in my song

O Lord be magnified (x)

Be magnified O Lord
You are highly exalted

And the is nothing You can't do
Oh Lord my eyes are on You

Be magnified
Oh Lord be magnified
