Title: Count On Me Through Thick and Thin...


Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end

When You are weak I will be strong
Helping You to carry on

Call on me, I will be there

Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say

Count on me

I can see it's hurting You
I can feel Your pain

It's hard to see the sunshine through the rain
I know sometimes it seems as if

It's never gonna end
But you'll get through it

Just don't give in 'cause You can

Count on me through thick and thin
A friendship that will never end

When You are weak I will be strong
Helping You to carry on

Call on me, I will be there

Don't be afraid
Please believe me when I say

Count on me

I know sometimes it seems as if
We're standing all alone

But we'll get through it
Cuz love won't let us fall

Count on me through thick and thin

There's a place inside all of us
Where our faith in love begins

You should reach to find the truth in love
The answers' there within, oh

I know that life can make You feel
It's much harder than it really is

But we'll get through it
Just don't give in
