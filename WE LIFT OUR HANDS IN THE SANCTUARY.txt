Title: WE LIFT OUR HANDS IN THE SANCTUARY


We lift our hands in the sanctuary
We lift our hands to give You the glory

We lift our hands to give You the praise
And we will praise You for the rest of our days

Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Jesus, we give You the praise
Emmanuel, we lift up Your name

Heavenly Father, coming Messiah

And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, will praise You for the rest of our days

Yes, yes, Lord for the rest of our days

Hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah for the rest of our days

And we will praise You for the rest of our days

We SING A SONG in the sanctuary
We SING A SONG to give You the glory

We SING A SONG to give You the praise

And we will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

We will praise You for the rest of our days
Yes, we will praise You for the rest of our days

Yes, Lord for the rest of our days
