Title: There Is A River and It Flows From Deep Within


There is a river and it flows from deep  within
There is a fountain that frees the soul  from sin

Come to this water
There is a vast supply

There is a river that never shall run dry

There was a thirsty woman
She was drawing from the well

See, her life was ruined and wasted

And her soul was bound for hell
Oh, but then she met the Master and He  told her of her sin

And He said, “If You drink this water,  you’ll never thirst again”

There is a river and it flows from deep  within
There is a fountain that frees the soul  from sin

Come to this water
There is a vast supply

There is a river that never shall run dry

Lose all Your guilty stains
Lose all Your guilty stains

Oh, come to this water
There is a vast supply

There is a river that never shall run dry
There is a river that never shall run dry
