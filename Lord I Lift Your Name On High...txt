Title: Lord I Lift Your Name On High..


Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love Your praises

I'm so glad You reign in my life
I'm so glad You came to save me

You came from heaven to earth
To show the way

From the earth to the cross

My debt You paid
From the cross to the grave

From the grave to the throne
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I lift Your name on high
