Title: GIVE US OH LORD THY UNCTION


Give us o Lord thine unction
Aniont us for thine work

Arise and set us in motion
O Lord the man of war

Baptize us Lord with thy fire
And set our souls aflame

To burn and shine for thy cause
Revive Your zeal in us

Refine us Lord and cleanse us
Clothe us in holiness

Transform our thoughts and nature
Till we Your glory show

New hearts, more love, more passion
For souls in satan's train

With hook or net use still
Make us fishers of men

Not gold, not power, not knowledge
Will thy heavens unlock

But prayer and faith and unity
Will bring the latter rain

With tears and groans and fasting
O lord, help us to pray

Travailing as in birth for souls
Till You revive the church
