Title: Anybody In Here Depended On Jesus


Anybody in here depended on Jesus
I mean like totally depended on Jesus

And it's no point without Him
It's a waste of time without Him

Right?
Yeah, feel free to sing with us

The song is simple it says!

Chorus 3
Tell me what can I do?
'Cause I can't live without You

I can't live without You

So here's my heart
Here's my mind

I give You my soul, Lord
Need You to take control

'Cause I've tried it
Tried it on my own but

What I found is I can't make it

On my own, on my own
I can't make it

I can't make it
On my own, on my own

I can't make it
I can't make it

'Cause I've tried it
Tried it on my own but

What I found is I can't make it
