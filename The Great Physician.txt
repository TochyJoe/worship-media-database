Title: The Great Physician


Chorus 1
Sweetest note in seraph song
Sweetest name on mortal tongue

Sweetest carol ever sung
Jesus, blessed Jesus

Verse 1
The great Physician now is near
The sympathizing Jesus

He speaks the drooping heart to cheer
O hear the voice of Jesus!

Verse 2
Your many sins are all forgiven
O hear the voice of Jesus!

Go on Your way
In peace to heaven

And wear a crown with Jesus

Verse 3
All glory to the dying Lamb
I now believe in Jesus

I love the blessed Savior's name
I love the name of Jesus

Verse 4
And when to that bright world above
We rise to be with Jesus

We'll sing around the throne of love
His name, the name of Jesus

Verse 5
His name dispels my guilt and fear
No other name but Jesus

O how my soul delights to hear
The precious name of Jesus
