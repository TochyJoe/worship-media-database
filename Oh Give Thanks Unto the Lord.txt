Title: Oh Give Thanks Unto the Lord


Oh give thanks unto the Lord
For He is Good

For His mercy endureth forever and ever

Thy art my God and I will Praise You

For His mercy endureth forever and ever

The Lord is my strength and my song
He has become my salvation, my salvation

I will praise You oh Lord
You have become my salvation, my salvation

For this is the day that the Lord hath made
I will rejoice and be glad in it

For His mercy endureth forever and ever

Oh Give thanks unto the Lord

His mercy endureth forever

His mercy endureth forever
And ever and ever
