Title: GOD IS ABLE


God is able
He will never fail

He is almighty God
Greater than all we seek

Greater than all we ask
He has done great things

Lifted up
He defeated the grave

Raised to life
Our God is able

In His name
We overcome

For the Lord
Our God is able

God is with us
God is on our side

He will make a way
Far above all we know

Far above all we hope
He has done great things

Lifted up
He defeated the grave

Raised to life
Our God is able

In His name
We overcome

For the Lord
Our God is able

God is with us
He will go before

He will never leave us
He will never leave us

God is for us
He has open arms

He will never fail us
He will never fail us

[Chorus ]
Lifted up

He defeated the grave
Raised to life

Our God is able
In His name

We overcome
For the Lord

Our God is able

For the Lord
Our God is able

For the Lord
Our God is able

Everyone needs compassion
A love that's never failing

Let mercy fall on me
Everyone needs forgiveness

A kindness of a Savior
The hope of nations

My Savior
He can move the mountains

My God is Mighty to save
He is Mighty to save

Forever
Author of salvation

He rose and conquered the grave
Jesus conquered the grave

So take me as You find me
All my fears and failures

Fill my life again
I give my life to follow

Everything I believe in
Now I surrender

Shine Your light and let the whole world see
We're singing for the glory of the risen King...Jesus
