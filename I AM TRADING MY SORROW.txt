Title: I AM TRADING MY SORROW


Verse 1
I'M PRESSED BUT NOT CRUSHED
PERSECUTED NOT ABANDONED

STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT DESTROYED
I'M BLESSED BEYOND THE CURSE

FOR HIS PROMISE WILL ENDURE

AND HIS JOY'S GONNA BE MY STRENGTH
THOUGH THE SORROW MAY

LAST FOR THE NIGHT
HIS JOY COMES IN THE MORNING

Chorus 1
I AM TRADING MY SORROW
I'M TRADING MY SHAME

I'M LAYING THEM DOWN FOR THE JOY OF THE Lord
I'M TRADING MY SICKNESS

I'M TRADING MY PAIN
I'M LAYING THEM DOWN FOR THE JOY OF THE Lord

Chorus 1
YES LORD, YES LORD
YES, YES Lord

AMEN

La la la la la la la ala la la la
Amen
