Title: I Know That I Can Make It


You don't have to worry
And don't You be afraid

Joy comes in the morning
Troubles they don't last always

For there's a friend named Jesus
Who will wipe Your tears away

And if Your heart is broken
Just lift Your hands and say

I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand

No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand

No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

So when Your tests and trials
They seem to get You down

And all Your friends and loved ones
Are nowhere to be found

Remember there's a friend named Jesus
Who will wipe Your tears away

And if Your heart is broken
Just lift Your hands and say

I know that I can make it
I know that I can stand

No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands

With Jesus I can take it
With Him I know I can stand

No matter what may come my way
My life is in Your hands
