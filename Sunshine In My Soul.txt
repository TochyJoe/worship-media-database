Title: Sunshine In My Soul


Chorus 1
O there's sunshine, blessed sunshine
When the peaceful happy moments roll

When Jesus shows His smiling face
There is sunshine in my soul

Verse 1
There is sunshine in my soul today
More glorious and bright

Than glows in any earthly sky
For Jesus is my light

Verse 2
There is music in my soul today
A carol to my King

And Jesus, listening can hear
The songs I cannot sing

Verse 3
There is springtime in my soul today
For when the Lord is near

The dove of peace sings in my heart
The flow'rs of grace appear

Verse 4
There is gladness in my soul today
And hope and praise and love

For blessings which He gives me now
For joys "laid up" above
