Title: WATER YOU


WATER You TURNED INTO WINE
OPEN THE EYES OF THE BLIND

THERE IS NO ONE LIKE YOU, NONE LIKE You

INTO THE DARKNESS, WE SHINE
OUT OF THE ASHES WE RISE

THERE IS NO ONE LIKE YOU, NONE LIKE You

OUR God IS GREATER, OUR God IS STRONGER
God You ARE HIGHER THAN ANY OTHER

OUR God IS HEALER, AWESOME IN POWER
OUR God (OUR GOD)

AND IF OUR God IS FOR US, THEN WHO COULD EVER STOP  US
AND IF OUR God IS WITH US, THEN WHAT CAN STAND  AGAINST

I AM YOURS, You ARE MINE
TAKE MY HEART AND MY MIND

OPEN THE EYES OF MY HEART

REVEAL YOURSELF Lord
I WANT YOU,ITS MY DESIRE

OH OH OH You ARE MY DESIRE

HEAR THE SONG, FROM OUR HEART
WE WANT MORE, OPEN OUR HEART

LET US UNDERSTAND

THE SENTIMENT OF Your HEART
POUR OUT Your SPIRIT Lord

OH OH OH You ARE MY DESIRE
