Title: King of Kings and Lord of Lords


King of Kings and Lord of Lords
Lover of my soul Jehovah

One and only God I am
Jesus Christ the Holy Lamb

Thy truth reaches the clouds
Your mercy never runs out

We give You honor
Be thou exalted

Above the heavens and above the earth
I give all Glory unto Your name

Hills melt in Your presence
And Your foes tremble at Your

Awesome power
I will rejoice now and forever 'cause You are mine

So gracious and so divine

He's a wonder, he's a wonder
He's a wonder, he's a wonder

He's a wonder, he's a wonder
He's a mighty God
