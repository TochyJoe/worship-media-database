Title: I Do Believe


Chorus 1
I do believe, I now believe
That Jesus died for me

Verse 1
Father, I stretch my hands to Thee
No other help I know

If Thou withdraw thyself from me
Ah, whither shall I go?

Verse 2
What did Thine only Son endure
Before I drew my breath!

What pain, what labor
To secure my soul from endless death!

Verse 3
Author of faith, to Thee I lift
My weary, longing eyes

Oh, let me now receive that gift
My soul, without it, dies

Verse 4
Surely Thou canst not let me die
Oh, speak, and I shall live

And here I will unwearied lie
Till Thou Thy Spirit give

Verse 5
How would my fainting soul rejoice
Could I but see Thy face!

Now let me hear Thy quick'ning voice
And taste Thy pard'ning grace
