Title: MINISTER TO YA


Times New Roman
While I was in the spirit

God showed me some things
He told me some things, revealed some things

While I was in the spirit
God pointed out some things that I needed to know

He showed my enemies and my friends too
How to look at my troubles and walk right through

Chorus 1
If I need to know God's plan for my life
Get in the spirit, let the Lord minister to ya

Verse 2
WHILE IN THE SPIRIT
God CHANGED SOME THINGS

HE EXPLAINED THINGS, ARRANGED SOME THINGS

While in the spirit
God broke down some things in my life that needed to go

Have You ever been broken before the Lord
You were down on Your knees

You were wondering which way to go

Bridge 1
Oh Lord minister to me:
I say yes, I say yes

Oh Lord minister to me:
I say yes, I say yes

Chorus 2


If You need to know God's plan for Your life
Get in the spirit, say

Yes

If You need to know God's plan for Your life
Get in the spirit, say yes
