Title: Behold the Lord Upon His Throne


Verse 1
Behold the Lord upon his throne
His face is shining like the sun

With eyes blazing fire and feet  glowing bronze
His voice like mighty waters roar

Verse 1
The first, the last, the living one
Laid down his life for all the world

Behold he now lives
For evermore

And holds the keys of death and  hell

Chorus 1
Holy, Holy, Lord God Almighty
Holy, Holy, we bow before Your  throne

Verse 1
So let our praises ever ring
To Jesus Christ our glorious King

All heaven and earth
Resound as we cry

"Worthy is the Son of God"
