Title: While the World Looks Upon Me


While the world looks upon me
As I struggle along

They say I have nothing
But they are so wrong

In my heart I'm rejoicing
How I wish they could see

Thank You Lord
For Your blessing on me!

There's a roof up above me
I have a good place to sleep

There's food on my table
And shoes on my feet

You gave me Your love Lord
And a fine family

Thank You Lord
For Your blessings on me!

I know I'm not wealthy
These clothes, they're not new

I don't have much money
But Lord I have You

And to me, that's all that matters
Though the world may not see

Thank You Lord
For Your blessings on me!

There's a roof up above me
I have a good place to sleep

There's food on my table
And shoes on my feet

You gave me Your love Lord
And a fine family

Thank You Lord
