Title: The Lord Is My Shepherd


The Lord is my shepherd
I shall not want

He makes me lie down in green
Pastures. He leads me beside still waters

He restores my soul
He leads me in paths of righteousness

For his name's sake

Even though I walk through the
Valley of the shadow of death

I will fear no evil

For You are with me
Your rod and Your staff

They comfort me

You prepare a table before me
In the presence of my enemies

You anoint my head with oil
My cup overflows

Surely goodness and mercy shall
Follow me all the days of my life

And I shall dwell in the house of the
Lord forever
