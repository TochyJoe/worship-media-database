Title: PRAISE HIM WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET


Verse 1
Enter His gate with thanksgiving
Come into His court with praise

Enter His presence rejoicing
Singing great and mighty is his name

PRAISE HIM WITH THE SOUND OF THE TRUMPET
PRAISE HIM WITH THE TIMBRELS AND HARPS

FOR THE Lord IS GOOD AND HIS MERCIES ENDURETH FOREVER

LET EVERY CREATURE IN HEAVEN AND EARTH
SING A SONG OF PRAISE

SING WITH ALL Your HEART
