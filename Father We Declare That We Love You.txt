Title: Father We Declare That We Love You


And we will say
That You are good

And all the miracles
You’ve done have brought us joy

For we are change
And all the hope we have

We place in You right now

Father we declare that we love You
We declare our everlasting love for You

Father we declare that we love You
We declare our everlasting love for You
