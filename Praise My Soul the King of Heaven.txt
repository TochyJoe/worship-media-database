To his feet Your tribute bring

Ransomed, healed, restored, forgiven

Evermore His praises sing
Alleluia, alleluia!

To His people in distress

Father like He tends and spares us
Well our feeble frame He knows

In His hand He gently bears us

Rescues us from all our foes

Widely yet His mercy flows

Angels, help us to adore Him
You behold Him face to face

Sun and moon, bow down before Him

All who dwell in time and space
Alleluia, alleluia!
