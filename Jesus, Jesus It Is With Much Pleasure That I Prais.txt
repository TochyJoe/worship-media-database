Title: Jesus, Jesus It Is With Much Pleasure That I Prais


Jesus, Jesus it is with much pleasure that I praise Your name
Jesus, Jesus it is with much pleasure that I praise Your name

The birds of the air they sing unto You
The trees on the field they clap their hands

The hills and the mountains burst into songs
So why shouldn't I praise Your name?
