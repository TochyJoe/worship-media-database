Title: You May Have the Joy Bells


Chorus 1
Joy bells ringing in Your heart!
Joy bells ringing in Your heart!

Take the Savior here below
With You ev'rywhere You go

He will keep the joy bells
Ringing in Your heart

Verse 1
You may have the joy bells
Ringing in Your heart

And a peace that
From You never will depart

Walk the straight and narrow way
Live for Jesus ev'ry day

He will keep the joy bells
Ringing in Your heart

Verse 2
Love of Jesus in its fullness
You may know

And this love to those around
You sweetly show

Words of kindness always say
Deeds of mercy do each day

Then He'll keep the joy bells
Ringing in Your heart

Verse 3
You will meet with trials
As You journey home

Grace sufficent He will give to overcome
Tho' unseen by mortal eye

He is with You evernigh
And He'll keep the joy bells

Ringing in Your heart

Verse 4
Let Your life speak well
Of Jesus ev'ry day

Own His right to ev'ry service
You can pay

Sinners You can help to win
If Your life is pure and clean

And You keep the joy bells
Ringing in Your heart
