Title: GOD MOST HIGH.


O God MOST HIGH, almighty King
The champion of heaven, Lord of everything

You've fought, you've won, death's lost its sting
And standing in Your victory we sing

You have broken the chains
That held our captive souls

You have broken the chains
And used them on Your foes

All Your enemies are bound
They tremble at the sound of Your name

Jesus, You have broken the chains!

The power of hell has been undone

Captivity held captive by the Risen One
And in the name of God's great Son

We claim the mighty victory you've won
You have broken the chains

That held our captive souls
You have broken the chains

And used them on Your foes
All Your enemies are bound

They tremble at the sound of Your name
Jesus, You have broken the chains!

Jesus, You have broken the chains!
