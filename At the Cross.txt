Title: At the Cross


Chorus 1
At the cross, at the cross
Where I first saw the light

And the burden of my heart rolled away
It was there by faith, I received my sight

And now I am happy all the day!

Verse 1
Alas and did my Savior bleed
And did my sov'reign die?

Would He devote that sacred head
For such a worm as I?

Verse 2
Was it for crimes that I have done
He groaned upon the tree?

Amazing pity grace unknown
And love beyond degree!

Verse 3
Well might the sun in darkness hide
And shut His glories in

When Christ the mighty Maker died
For man the creature's sin

Verse 4
But drops of grief can ne'er repay
The debt of love I owe

Here, Lord, I give myself to Thee
'Tis all that I can do!

Verse 5
Thus might I hide my blushing face
While Calvary's cross appears

Dissolve my heart in thankfulness
And melt mine eyes to tears
