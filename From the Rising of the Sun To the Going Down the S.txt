From the rising of the sun To the going down the same

You will never ever change You will always be the same

You're the sun that shines by day And the moon that shines by  night

You will always make a way Where there seems to be no way

You be God, You be king
My provider, My sustainer

For the life I get today
Na You give am to me

For the money I get today
Na You give am to me

For the voice I get today
Na You give am to me

For the house I dey live today
Na You give am to me
