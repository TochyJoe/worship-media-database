Title: BACK TO YOU (PRODIGAL SON)


OOOOOOO
OOO   OOOOOO

COMING BACK TO You
COMINGBACK

COMING BACK TO YOU

I’M THE LOST SHEEP
THE PRODIGAL SON

I’VE LOST MY WAY
IN THE MIDST OF THE CROWD

FOLLOWING TREND
SORO UWA N’AGA

(going with the world)

MANA, NWA BIARA IJE NWE ULA
(but the journey man must head home)

THIS IS WHERE I START
AGA M AGA (I’ll go)

WEE GAKURU NNA MO
(I’ll go to my father)

RIGHT ON MY KNEELS
AGA M AGA, WEE GAAKURU NNA MO

(I’ll go to my father)
SI YA ABBA FATHER

HERE I COME

Chorus 1


I’M COMING BACK TO You
COMING BACK AS Your OWN

FORGIVE MY SINS TO You
WASH ME WHITE AS THE SNOW

I ASK FOR NO FEAST
I’VE WASTED THE YEARS

WASTED THE FUND
NNA GBAHARU M

(father forgive me)

OBARA ATURU
(blood of the Lamb)

WASH ALL MY SINS
SO I’LL BE

AS WHITE AS THE SNOW

I BELIEVE IN YOU
THE SON OF God

I’M BACK TO RECEIVE
Jesus THE CHRIST

NOW I’M SAVED BY GRACE
WASHED IN THE BLOOD

I AM BACK TO THE ARMS OF MY God

THERE IS NO DISGRACE
Jesus IS HERE

MY NAME IN THE LAMB’S BOOK OF LIFE
