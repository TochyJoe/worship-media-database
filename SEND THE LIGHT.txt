There is a call comes ringing o'er the restless
Wave, "send the light! send the light"

There are souls to rescure, there are souls to save
Send the light!

Send the light!

Send the light the blessed gosple light
Let it shine from shore dto shore!

Send the light the blessed gosple light;let it shine  forevemore!

We have the macedonian call todays,"send
The light! send the light!"

And a golden off'ring at the cross we lay
Send the light!

Send the light!

Let us pray that grace may ev'rywhere abound
"send the light! send the light!"

And a christ-like spirit ev'rywhere be found
Send the light!

Send the light!

Let us grow weary in the work of love,"ssend
The light! send the light!"

Let us gather jewels for a crown above
Send the light!

Send the light!
