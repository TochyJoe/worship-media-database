Title: All Hail the Power of Jesus' Name!


All hail the power of Jesus' name!
Let angels prostrate fall

Bring forth the royal diadem
And crown him Lord of all

Bring forth the royal diadem

And crown him Lord

2 O seed of Israel's chosen race
Now ransomed from the fall

Hail him who saves You by his grace
And crown him Lord of all

Hail him who saves You by his grace
And crown him Lord of all!

3 Let every tongue and every tribe
Responsive to his call

To him all majesty ascribe
And crown him Lord of all

To him all majesty ascribe
And crown him Lord of all!

4 Oh, that with all the sacred throng
We at his feet may fall!

We'll join the everlasting song
And crown him Lord of all

We'll join the everlasting song
And crown him Lord of all
