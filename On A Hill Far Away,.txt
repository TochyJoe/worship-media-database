Title: On A Hill Far Away,


Verse 1
On a hill far away
Stood an old rugged Cross

The emblem of suff'ring and shame

And I love that old Cross
Where the dearest and best

For a world of lost sinners was slain

Verse 1
And I'll cherish the old rugged Cross
Until my trophies at last I lay down

I will cling to the old rugged Cross
And exchange it some day for a crown

Verse 1
To the old rugged Cross
I will ever be true

Its shame and reproach gladly bear

And they'll call me some
Day to my home far away

Where His glory forever I'll share

And exchange it some day for a crown
