Title: The Storm Is Over


Verse 1
I was in a tunnel
And couldn't see the light

And whenever I'd look up
I couldn't see the sky

Sometimes when I'm standin'
It seems like I done walked for miles

Verse 1
And my heart could be cryin'
Dead in the middle of a smile

But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains

I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind

Heard a small voice sayin'

Chorus 1
The storm is over
(The storm is over now)

And I can see the sunshine
(Somewhere beyond the clouds)

I feel Heaven, yeah
(Heaven is over me)

Come on and set me free, whoa

Verse 1
Now in the midst of my battle
All hope was gone

Downtown in a rushed crowd
And felt all alone

And every now and then
I felt like I would lose my mind

I've been racin' for years
And still no finish line, oh

Verse 1
But then I climbed the hills
And saw the mountains (Mountains)

I hollered help 'cause I was lost
Then I felt the strong wind

And then a small voice sayin'

Verse 1
Somehow my beginning stepped right in (Right in)
Then faith became my friend (My friend)

And now I can depend
On the voices of the wind

When it's sayin' (Sayin')
