Title: LEAN ON ME


Verse 1
THERE’S A MAN
STANDING ON THE CORNER

HE HAS NO HOME
HE HAS NO FOOD

AND HIS BLUE SKIES ARE GONE
CAN You HEAR HIM CRYING OUT

Verse 1
AND THERE’S A GIRL
SEARCHING FOR A Father AND A  FRIEND

PRAYING THAT THE STORM SOME  DAY WILL END
BUT INSTEAD OF WALKING AWAY

OPEN UP Your HEART AND SAY

Chorus 1
I AM HERE
You DON’T HAVE TO WORRY

I CAN SEE Your TEARS
I’LL BE THERE IN A HURRY WHEN  You CALL

FRIENDS ARE THERE TO CATCH  You WHEN You FALL
HERE’S MY SHOULDER You CAN  LEAN ON ME

Verse 1
THERE’S A CHILD
WHO IS SICK AND BEGGING TO BE  FREE

FOR THERE’S NO CURE FOR HIS  DISEASE
HE LOOKED UP TO HIS MOTHER

AS SHE HOLDS (HOLDS)
HIS HANDS (HIS HANDS)

PRAYING THAT SOMEDAY
THE SUN WILL SHINE AGAIN

AND THE PAIN WILL END

Chorus 1
I AM HERE
You DON’T HAVE TO WORRY

I CAN SEE Your TEARS
I’LL BE THERE IN A HURRY WHEN  You CALL

FRIENDS ARE THERE TO CATCH  You WHEN You FALL
HERE’S MY SHOULDER You CAN  LEAN ON ME

Verse 1
TELL ME HOW CAN I
HOW CAN I LOVE Jesus

WHEN I’VE NEVER SEEN HIS FACE
YET I SEE You DYING

AND I TURN AND WALK AWAY
SO HOLD MY HANDS

LET ME TAKE You TO A FRIEND OF  MINE

Verse 1
WHO’S WAITING JUST TO HEAL A  TROUBLED MIND
HE LOVES You MORE THAN You  EVER KNOW

BUT INSTEAD OF WALKING AWAY
(OPEN UP) OPEN UP Your HEART  AND SAY

Verse 1
I AM HERE
You DON’T HAVE TO WORRY

I CAN SEE Your TEARS
I’LL BE THERE IN A HURRY WHEN  YOUCALL

FRIENDS ARE THERE TO CATCH  You WHEN You FALL
HERE’S MY SHOULDER You CAN  LEAN ON ME

Verse 1
 FROM THE RISING OF THE SUN
TO THE SETTING OF THE SAME

LET THE NAME OF THE Lord BE  PRAISED
AND UNTILL MY DYING DAY

WHEN THERE’S NO MORE I CAN  SAY
LET THE NAME OF THE Lord BE  PRAISED

(REPEAT CHORUS)
