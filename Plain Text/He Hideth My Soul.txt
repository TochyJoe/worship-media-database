Title: He Hideth My Soul


Chorus 1
He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

That shadows a dry, thirsty land
He hideth my life

In the depths of His love
And covers me there with His hand

And covers me there with His hand

Verse 1
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
A wonderful Savior to me

He hideth my soul
In the cleft of the rock

Where rivers of pleasure I see

Verse 2
A wonderful Savior is Jesus my Lord
He taketh my burden away

He holdeth me up
And I shall not be moved

He giveth me strength as my day

Verse 3
With numberless blessings
Each moment He crowns

And filled with His fullness divine
I sing in my rapture, "Oh, glory to God

For such a Redeemer as mine!"

Verse 4
When clothed in His brightness
Transported I rise

To meet Him in clouds of the sky
His perfect salvation

His wonderful love I'll shout
With the millions on high
