Title: You Unravel Me, With A Melody


You unravel me, with a melody
You surround me with a song

Of deliverance, from my enemies
Till all my fears are gone

I'm no longer a slave to fear
I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to sin
I am a child of God

From my mothers womb
You have chosen me

Love has called my name
I've been born again, into Your family

Your blood flows through my veins

I'm no longer a slave to sin
I am a child of God

I am surrounded by the arms of the Father
I am surrounded by songs of deliverance

We'll be liberated from our bondage
We're the sons and the daughters

Let us sing our freedom

Ohh. ohh. ohh

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it

All my fears were drowned in perfect love

You rescued me
So I could stand and sing

I am a child of God

You split the sea
So I could walk right through it

All my fears were drowned in perfect love

You rescued me
So I could stand and sing

I am a child of God

I'm no longer a slave to sin
I am a child of God
