Title: I DON’T KNOW HOW


Verse 1
I DON’T KNOW HOW
TO SAY EXACTLY

HOW I FEEL
AND I CAN’T BEGIN

TO TELL You
WHAT Your LOVE HAS MEANT

I’M LOST FOR WORDS

Verse 1
IS THERE A WAY
TO SHOW THE PASSION

IN MY HEART
CAN I EXPRESS

HOW TRULY GREAT I THINK You ARE
MY DEAREST FRIEND

Verse 1
THIS IS MY DESIRE
TO POUR MY LOVE ON You

LIKE OIL UPON Your FEET
LIKE WINE FOR You TO DRINK

LIKE WATER FROM MY HEART
I POUR MY LOVE ON You

Verse 1
IF PRAISE IS LIKE PERFUME
I'LL LAVISH MINE ON You

TILL EVERY DROP IS GONE
I'LL POUR MY LOVE ON You
