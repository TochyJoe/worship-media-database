Title: I Would Love To Tell You What I Think of Jesus,


Verse 1
I would love to tell You what I  think of Jesus
Since I found in Him a friend so  strong and true

I would tell You how
He changed my life completely

He did something no other  friend could do

Verse 1
No one ever cared for me like  Jesus
There's no other friend so kind as  He

No one else could take the sin
And darkness from me

O how much He cared for me

Verse 1
All my life was full of sin when  Jesus found me
All my heart was full of misery  and woe

Jesus placed His strong arms  about me
And He led me in the way I   ought to go

Verse 1
Ev'ry day He comes to me with  new assurance
More and more I understand His  word of love

But I'll never know just why He  came to save me
Till someday I see His blessed  face above
