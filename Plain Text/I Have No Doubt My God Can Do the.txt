Title: I Have No Doubt My God Can Do the


Arial Black;  verse
I have no doubt my God can do the impossible

I know he can; I've seen him do it

He can turn the mess you're in
To an awesome miracle

I know he can
I've seen him do it

Whatever problem you've got
I have no doubt my God can do the impossible

I know he can
I've seen him do it

He can turn the mess you're in into an awesome miracle
I know he can, I've seen him do it

Whatever problem you've got, if You just give it to God
He'll work it out

How do I know

I've seen him do it, I've seen him do it

Ooh ooh
I've seen him do it

Ooh ooh
I've seen him do it

When Your life has gone astray
He'll preserve and cover You with his grace

That' how God works, I've seen him do it

Then he'll erase Your past
So people can never dangle it in Your face

That's how God works, I've seen him do it

You need a miracle
He's more than capable

How do I know, how do I know (modulate)

God never fails, My God never fails

[Modulate]
God never fails, My God never fails

I've seen him, I've seen him do it
I've seen him do it

I've seen him do it

Yes---- I've seen him do it

I've seen him do it [REPEAT]

Yes---- I've seen him do it
