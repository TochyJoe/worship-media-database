Title: FACING A TASK UNFINISHED


Facing a task unfinished
That drives us to our knees

A need that, undiminished
Rebukes our slothful ease

We, who rejoice to know thee
Renew before thy throne

The solemn pledge we owe thee
To go and make thee known

Where other lords beside thee
Hold their unhindered sway

Where forces that defied thee
Defy thee still today

With none to heed their crying
For life, and love, and light

Unnumbered souls are dying
And pass into the night

We bear the torch that flaming
Fell from the hands of those

Who give their lives proclaming
That Jesus died and rose

Ours is the same commission
The same glad message ours

Fired by the same ambition
To the we yield our powers

O Father who sustained them
O spirit who inspired

Saviour, whose love constrained them
To toil with zeal untired

From lethargy awake!
Forth on thine errands send us

To labour for thy sake
