Title: Let Our Worship Rise Tonight, God


Let our worship rise tonight, God
We'll pour our love on You

Break open our box
Give You everything

From here to there
Worship is filling the atmosphere

Both now and then
Songs of Your love will never end

All day and night
As we bow down our praise will rise

Inside and out
All that I am will shout

Let my worship rise
Like a sweet perfume

I'll pour my love, my love
All over You
