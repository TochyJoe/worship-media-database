Title: Aiyee! God Has Given Me Victory


He has given me victory
All of you, God has given me victory

He has given me victory

All the days of my life I’ll praise You
Everything that I have na You gave to me Baba

Lord I say for Your Love I’m grateful
Jesu You love me plenty, You came to die for me

Jehovah Rapha Jehovah Nissi
I Am that I Am, The Great provider

I searched around, there’s no one else like You
Lion of Judah: You’re the mighty Man in battle

Aiyee! God has given me victory
Aiyee! He has given me victory

Hallelujah eh (Halle) (Repeat)

Come and see what the Lord has done for me
He has taken away my sorrows and now I’m free!

Agam e buru hallelujah e buru (I will carry hallelujah)
Agam a para hallelujah para o (I will carry my praise)

Because of Jesus everyday na shakara I dey do
(Because of Jesus everyday I have a life worth showing off)

Double double heavenly blessings na him I dey receive (from  Him I receive)
God Your Grace and mercies always dey follow me

If Jesus has given You victory
Come let’s dance, let’s give Him praises now
