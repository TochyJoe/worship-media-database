Title: Joy Unspeakable


Chorus 1
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory
Full of glory, full of glory

It is joy unspeakable and full of glory
Oh the half has never yet been told!

Verse 1
I have found His grace in all complete
He supplieth every need

While I sit and learn at Jesus feet
I am free, yes, free indeed

Verse 2
I have found the pleasure I once craved
It is joy and peace within

What a wondrous blessing! I am saved
From the awful gulf of sin

Verse 3
I have found that hope
So bright and clear

Living in the realm of grace
Oh the Savior's presence is so near

I can see His smiling face

Verse 4
I have found the joy no tongue can tell
How its waves of glory roll!

It is like a great o'er flowing well
Springing up within my soul
