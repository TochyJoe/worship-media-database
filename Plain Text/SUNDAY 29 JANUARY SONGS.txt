Title: SUNDAY 29 JANUARY SONGS


Jesus AT THE CENTRE

At the center of it all
It’s You that I see

There is power in Your name
Miracles happen in Your name

As we lift our voice in praise
It’s You that I see

Bridge 1
You are bigger
Bigger than the biggest

You are stronger
Stronger than the strongest

You are higher
Higher than the highest

You are greater
Greater than the greatest

Jesus

CALL TO WORSHIP

To him who sits
On the throne

And unto the lamb
[repeat]

Be blessing and glory
And honor and power

Forever
[repeat]
