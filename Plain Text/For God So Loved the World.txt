Title: For God So Loved the World


Chorus 1
For God so loved the world
That He gave His only begotten Son

That whosoever believeth in Him
Whosoever believeth in Him

Should not perish should not perish
But have everlasting life

Verse 1
A story sweet and wondrous
Like heavenly music swells

In chimings clear to all who will hear
Ring out the gospel bells

Verse 2
When, grieving brokenhearted
Because of sin and shame

We find a joy earth cannot destroy
Believing on His name

Verse 3
This love, beyond all measure
Of earth or sea or sky

Could only show its full overflow
When Jesus came to die

Verse 4
Come, brother come to Jesus
His word was meant for you

His grace receive, His promise believe
And sing His praise anew
