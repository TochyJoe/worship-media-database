Title: LORD I Receive LORD I Receive;


Fear not, little flock, from the cross to the throne
From death into life He went for His own

All power in earth, all power above
Is given to Him for the flock of His love

Only believe, only believe
All things are possible, only believe

Only believe, only believe
All things are possible, only believe

Lord I believe, Lord I believe
All things are possible, Lord I believe

Lord I believe, Lord I believe
All things are possible, Lord I believe

Lord I receive, Lord I receive
All things are possible, Lord I receive

Lord I receive, Lord I receive
All things are possible, Lord I receive

Fear not, little flock, He goeth ahead
Your Shepherd selecteth the path You must tread

The waters of Marah He’ll sweeten for thee
He drank all the bitter in Gethsemane

Fear not, little flock, whatever Your lot
He enters all rooms, “the doors being shut”

He never forsakes, He never is gone
So count on His presence in darkness and dawn
