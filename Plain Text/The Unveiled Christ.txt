Title: The Unveiled Christ


Chorus 1
O, behold the Man of sorrows!
O, behold Him in plain view!

Lo! He is the mighty conqu'ror
Since He rent the veil in two

Lo! He is the mighty conqu'ror
Since He rent the veil in two

Verse 1
Once our blessed Christ of beauty
Was veiled off from human view

But thro' suff'ring, death, and sorrow
He has rent the veil in two

Verse 2
Yes, He is with God, the Father
Interceding there for you

For He is the mighty conqu'ror
Since He rent the veil in two

Verse 3
Holy angels bow before Him
Men of earth give praises due

For He is the well beloved
Since He rent the veil in two

Verse 4
Thro'out time and endless ages
Heights and depths of love so true

He alone can be the giver
Since He rent the veil in two
