Title: ANCIENT OF DAYS 2


As we enter Your gates
In Your courts we give thanks

With our voice singing blessings and glory
In our hearts we draw nigh

Lifted hands to the sky
We bow down at Your throne and cry worthy

Our God is the Lord
It is You we adore

As we sing let Your throne be exalted
Preparing the way

Your descent we await
As You dwell in the midst of our praises

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

We have hallowed this place
And Your banner we raise

As we cast down our crowns and cry holy
By Your stripes we are healed

And Your blood does reveal
The entrance to glory

The Holy of Holies

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

Now the lamb has been slain
In the book is my name

I will sing a new song thou art worthy

My greatest refrain
When He calls out my name

I'll sing glory and honor
I made it over

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days
With our hands lifted up we cry worthy

Praise, praise to the Ancient of Days

With our hands lifted up
With our hands lifted up

With our hands lifted up
With our hands lifted up

Worthy, Worthy
With our hands lifted up

(Repeat)

Holy, Holy
With our hands lifted up

(Repeat)

Awesome, Awesome
With our hands lifted up

(Repeat)

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
With our hands lifted up

(Repeat 4)

With our hands lifted up
We cry worthy
