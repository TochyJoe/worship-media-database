Title: His Yoke Is Easy


Chorus 1
His yoke is easy His burden is light
I've found it so I've found it so

His service is my sweetest delight
His blessings ever flow

Verse 1
I've found my Lord and He is mine
He won me by His love

I'll serve Him all my years of time
And dwell with Him above

Verse 2
No other Lord but Christ I know
I walk with Him alone

His streams of love forever flow
Within my heart His throne

Verse 3
He's dearer to my heart than life
He found me lost in sin

He calmed the sea of inward strife
And bid me come to Him

Verse 4
My flesh recoiled before the cross
And Satan whispers there

Thy gain will not repay the loss
His yoke is hard to bear

Verse 5
I've tried the road of sin and found
Its prospects all deceive

I've proved the Lord and joys abound
More than I could believe
