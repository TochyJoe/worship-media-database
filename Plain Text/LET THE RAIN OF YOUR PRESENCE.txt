Title: LET THE RAIN OF YOUR PRESENCE


Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
Every day that I live with every breath I breathe

Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
Every where that I go Lord let Your presence flow

Rain on me

Love Divine Joy unspeakable
Overflowing in my soul

This heart of mine is refreshed and at rest
In Your presence, in Your presence

Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
Every day that I live with every breath I breathe

Let the rain of Your presence fall on me
Every where that I go Lord let Your presence flow

Rain on me
