Title: Treasure of My Heart and of My Soul


Arial Black;  VERSE
Who is like You Lord in all the earth?

Matchless love and beauty, endless worth

Nothing in this world will satisfy
'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

Treasure of my heart and of my soul
In my weakness You are merciful

Redeemer of my past and present wrongs
Holder of my future days to come

Your presence is Heaven to me

Verse 1
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus

Your presence is Heaven to me

Verse 1
Oh Jesus, oh Jesus
Your presence is Heaven to me

All my days on earth I will await
The moment that I see You face to face

Nothing in this world can satisfy
'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry

'Cause Jesus You're the cup that won't run dry
You never run dry
