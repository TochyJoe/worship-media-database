Title: I Will Lift Up Mine Eyes To the Hills.


I will lift up mine eyes to the hills
From whence cometh my help

My help cometh from the Lord
The Lord which made Heaven and Earth

He said He would not suffer thy foot
Thy foot to be moved

The Lord which keepeth thee
He will not slumber nor sleep

Oh the Lord is thy keeper
The Lord is thy shade

Upon thy right hand
Upon thy right hand

No, the sun shall not smite Thee by day
Nor the moon by night

He shall preserve thy soul
Even forever more

My help, my help, my help
All of my help cometh from the Lord

I LIFT MY EYES UNTO THE HILLS
ALL OF MY HELP COMES FROM THE Lord
