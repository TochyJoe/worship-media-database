Title: I ALMOST LET GO


Times New Roman;  I ALMOST LET GO
I FELT LIKE I JUST COULDN'T TAKE LIFE ANY MORE

MY PROBLEMS HAD ME BOUND
DEPRESSION WEIGHED ME DOWN

BUT God HELD ME CLOSE
SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

GOD'S MERCY KEPT ME
SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

I ALMOST GAVE UP
I WAS RIGHT AT THE EDGE OF A BREAK THROUGH

BUT COULDN'T SEE IT
THE DEVIL REALLY HAD ME

BUT Jesus CAME AND GRABBED ME
AND HE HELD ME CLOSE

SO I WOULDN'T LET GO
GOD'S MERCY KEPT ME

SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

Chorus 1
SO I'M HERE TO DAY BECAUSE God KEPT ME
I'M A LIVE TODAY ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE

OH HE KEPT ME, God KEPT ME
HE KEPT ME

SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

I ALMOST LET GO
I FELT LIKE I JUST COULDN'T TAKE LIFE ANYMORE

MY PROBLEMS HAD ME BOUND
DEPRESSION WEIGHED ME DOWN

BUT God HELD ME CLOSE SO I WOULDN'T LET GO
GOD'S MERCY KEPT ME, SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

God KEPT ME, HE KEPT ME
God KEPT ME, HE KEPT ME

SO I'M HERE TO DAY BECAUSE God KEPT ME
I'M ALIVE TODAY ONLY BECAUSE OF HIS GRACE

OH HE KEPT ME, God KEPT ME
HE KEPT ME, SO I WOULDN'T LET GO

You DIDN'T KNOW HOW FAR GONE I WAS
God KEPT ME
