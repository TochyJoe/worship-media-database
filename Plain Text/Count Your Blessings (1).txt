Title: Count Your Blessings


Chorus 1
Count Your blessings
Name them one by one

Count Your blessings
See what God hath done

Count Your blessings
Name them one by one

Count Your many blessings
See what God hath done

Verse 1
When upon life's billows
You are tempest tossed

When You are discouraged
Thinking all is lost

Count Your many blessings
Name them one by one

And it will surprise You
What the Lord hath done

Verse 2
Are You ever burdened
With a load of care

Does the cross seem heavy
You are called to bear

Count Your many blessings
Every doubt will fly

And You will be singing
As the days go by

Verse 3
When You look at others
With their lands and gold

Think that Christ has promised
You His wealth untold

Count Your many blessings
Money cannot buy

Your reward in heaven
Nor Your home on high

Verse 4
So amid the conflict
Whether great or small

Do not be discouraged
God is over all

Count Your many blessings
Angels will attend

Help and comfort give You
To Your journey's end
