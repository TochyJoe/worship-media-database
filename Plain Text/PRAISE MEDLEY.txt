Title: PRAISE MEDLEY


Enter His gates with thanksgiving
Come into His courts with praise

Enter His presence rejoicing
Singing great and mighty is His name

Praise Him with the sound of the trumpet
Praise Him with the timbrel and harp

Let every creature in Heaven and earth
Lift a sound of praise, sing with all their heart

Chorus:
For the Lord is good

For the Lord is good
For the Lord is good

And his mercies endureth forever

We give You the highest praise
For You are worthy to be lifted up

For You are worthy worthy worthy
You are worthy to be lifted up

I love You Lord
I'm gonna lift up and praise Your holy name
