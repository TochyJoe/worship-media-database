Title: Onward, Christian Soldiers


Verse 1
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus going on before

Christ, the royal Master, leads against the foe
Forward into battle see His banners go!

Verse 1
Onward, Christian soldiers, marching as to war
With the cross of Jesus going on before

Verse 1
At the sign of triumph Satan's host doth flee
On then, Christian soldiers, on to victory!

Hell's foundations quiver at the shout of praise
Brothers lift Your voices, loud Your anthems raise

Verse 1
Like a mighty army moves the church of God
Brothers, we are treading where the saints have trod

We are not divided, all one body we
One in hope and doctrine, one in charity

Verse 1
What the saints established that I hold for true
What the saints believ?d, that I believe too

Long as earth endureth, men the faith will hold
Kingdoms, nations, empires, in destruction rolled

Verse 1
Crowns and thrones may perish, kingdoms rise and wane
But the church of Jesus constant will remain

Gates of hell can never gainst that church prevail
We have Christ's own promise, and that cannot fail

Verse 1
Onward then, ye people, join our happy throng
Blend with ours Your voices in the triumph song

Glory, laud and honor unto Christ the King
This through countless ages men and angels sing
