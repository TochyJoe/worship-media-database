Title: Guide Me O Thou Great Jehova


Verse 1
Guide me O Thou great Jehovah
[or Guide me, O Thou great Redeemer…]

Pilgrim through this barren land
I am weak, but Thou art mighty

Verse 1
Hold me with Thy powerful hand
Bread of Heaven, Bread of Heaven

Feed me till I want no more
Feed me till I want no more

Verse 1
Open now the crystal fountain
Whence the healing stream doth flow

Let the fire and cloudy pillar
Lead me all my journey through

Strong Deliverer, strong Deliverer
Be Thou still my Strength and Shield

Be Thou still my Strength and Shield

Verse 1
Lord, I trust Thy mighty power
Wondrous are Thy works of old

Thou deliver’st Thine from thralldom
Who for naught themselves had sold:

Thou didst conquer, Thou didst conquer
Sin, and Satan and the grave

Sin, and Satan and the grave

Verse 1
When I tread the verge of Jordan
Bid my anxious fears subside

Death of deaths, and hell’s destruction
Land me safe on Canaan’s side

Songs of praises, songs of praises
I will ever give to Thee

I will ever give to Thee

Verse 1
Musing on my habitation
Musing on my heav’nly home

Fills my soul with holy longings:

Come, my Jesus, quickly come
Vanity is all I see

Lord, I long to be with Thee!
Lord, I long to be with Thee!
