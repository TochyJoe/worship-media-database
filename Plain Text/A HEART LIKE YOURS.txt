Title: A HEART LIKE YOURS


I try to reach out for You but I fall
Sometimes You seem so close and yet so far

Oh I need another chance
I need to know Your mercy

Just give me the strength to change within
I know that I am not all that I can be

My weakness seems to get the best of me
But as long as You are here

I know that I will make it
Every step along the way

Please hear my prayer

A heart like yours, is my desire
A heart like yours, is what I am searching for

Full of compassion, nothing wrong within
Please hear me Lord, give me a heart like yours

So much grace, so much kindness
So much faith, for ever true

Strong as the wind, soft as the shadows
If just once, I could be like You
