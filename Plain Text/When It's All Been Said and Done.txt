Title: When It's All Been Said and Done


When it's all been said and done
There is just one thing that matters

Did I do my best to live for truth?
Did I live my life for you?

When it's all been said and done
All my treasures will mean nothing

Only what I've done for love's reward
Will stand the test of time

Lord, Your mercy is so great
That You look beyond our weakness

And find purest gold in miry clay
Turning sinners into saints

Hallelujah

And I will always sing Your praise
Here on earth and ever after

For you've shown me heavens, my true home
When it's all been said and done

You're my life when life is gone
