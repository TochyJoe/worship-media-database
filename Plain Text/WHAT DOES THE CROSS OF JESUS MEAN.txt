Title: WHAT DOES THE CROSS OF JESUS MEAN


What does the cross of Jesus mean?
It's more than songs we sing, much more than that

Emblem on Your chain
But it means I'm free, yes, from the chains of slavery

And the blood it shed won't let my sins remain

Upon the cross my Savior died, the Lamb was crucified
Showed us love that his world had never known

Oh what love divine, so divine, truer love you'll never find
So that we may live, love came and died alone

Well, the cross will always represent the love God had for me â??
When the Lord of glory, heaven-sent, gave all on Calvary --

Just for me [Repeat ]
Jesus came and did it just for me

Just for me [Repeat ]
Jesus came and did it just for me
