Verse 1
IN Your PRESENCE
I AM CONTEND

IN Your PRESENCE
I AM CONTEND

IN Your PRESENCE THERE IS LIFE,  EXPRESSION OF Your LOVE
REVELATIONS OF Your POWER  AND MIGHT

IN Your PRESENCE I CAN BRING  THE LOVE SONG OFFERING, I AM IN  THE PRESENCE OF MY KING

THERE IS NO HIGHER CALLING
NO GREATER HONOR

THAN TO BOW AND KNEEL
BEFORE Your THRONE

I’M AMAZED AT Your GLORY
EMBRACED BY Your MERCY

OH Lord
I LIVE TO WORSHIP You

Verse 1
AND I
I’M DESPERATE

FOR You
I’M LONGING

FOR You
I’M LOST

WITHOUT You
