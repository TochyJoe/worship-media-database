Title: Whenever I Call You Are there


Whenever I call You are there
Whenever I pray Lord You hear me

I'm not alone, this I know
What can I bring to You Lord

But this song of praise

Oghene doh
Doh doh doh

Oghene doh
Yeah

For the things You've done for me ...kiri doh
Doh doh kiri doh

For the life You gave me yeah

You brought me close to You...kiri doh
Doh doh kiri doh

And You call me Your own
What more can I say
