Title: Lord I Lift Your Name On High


[Chorus]
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You are in my life

I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay

From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I love to sing Your praises

I'm so glad You are in my life
I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay

From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high

You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay

From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky
Lord I lift Your name on high

[Chorus]
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I love to sing Your praises
I'm so glad You are in my life

I'm so glad You came to save us

You came from heaven to earth, to show the way
From the earth to the cross, my debt to pay

From the cross to the grave, from the grave to the sky

Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I lift Your name on high
Lord I lift Your name on high

Lord I lift Your name on high
