Title: You Love Like A Hurricane


You love like a hurricane
Cover mother darling you're a friend

We celebrate You
Today and always

Ever ready to listen
You tell us what we're missing

And make us write the vision

Then make it plain
God bless the very day You were born

Chorus 1
Happy happy birthday

Mummy Sarah
We love You

We say thank You

Appreciate You
We celebrate You

Happy happy birthday
