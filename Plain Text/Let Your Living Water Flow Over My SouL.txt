Title: Let Your Living Water Flow Over My SouL


Let Your living water flow over my soul
Let Your Holy Spirit come and take control

Of every situation that has troubled my mind
All my cares and burdens on to You I roll

Father, Father, Father

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

Give Your life to Jesus, let Him fill Your soul
Let Him take You in His arms and make You whole

As You give Your life to Him, He'll set You free
You will live and reign with Him eternally

Jesus, Jesus, Jesus

Come now Holy Spirit and take control
Hold me in Your loving arms and make me whole

Wipe away all doubt and fear and take my pride
Draw me to Your love and keep me by Your side

Spirit, Spirit, Spirit

Let Your living water flow over my soul
Let Your Holy Spirit come and take control

Of every situation that has troubled my mind
All my cares and burdens onto You I roll

Father, Jesus, Spirit
