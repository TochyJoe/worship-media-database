Title: Who


WHO HOLDS THE HEAVENS IN HIS HANDS
WHO MADE THE STARS BY THE WORD OF HIS POWER

WHO PUT HIS SPIRIT IN MAN
AND CAUSES ALL THE EARTH

TO CRY OUT GLORY

GLORY TO THE Lord WORSHIP HIM, THE God OF OUR SALVATION
GLORY TO THE Lord HONOUR HIM, HE REIGNS, HE RULES THE NATION

HE IS RIGHTEOUS AND WORTHY
TO BE WORSHIPPED AND ADORED

LIFT Your VOICE AND SING GLORY TO THE Lord
