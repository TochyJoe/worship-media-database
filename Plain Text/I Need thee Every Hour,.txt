Title: I Need thee Every Hour,


I need Thee every hour
Most gracious Lord

No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford

I need Thee, oh, I need Thee
Every hour I need Thee

Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
I come to Thee

I need Thee every hour
Stay Thou near by

Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh

I need Thee every hour
In joy or pain

Come quickly and abide
Or life is vain

I need Thee every hour
Teach me Thy will

And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill

I need Thee every hour
Most Holy One

Oh, make me Thine indeed
Thou blessed Son
