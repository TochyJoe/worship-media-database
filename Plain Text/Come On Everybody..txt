Almighty God in heaven
I lift my voice to  praise You

For all that You have dine for me

I just wanna testify
You have been my help in ages past and a hope for tomorrow

You have been my help guiding me through it all and showing  me the way

For the Lord is my keeper
And the Lord is my shield

So let us sing praises to our king

Eh mma mma imela
