Title: JESUS LAMB OF GOD


Verse 1
Jesus LAMB OF God WORTHY IS Your NAME

You ARE MY STRENGTH WHEN I AM WEAK
You ARE THE TREASURE THAT I SEEK

You ARE MY ALL IN ALL

SEEKING You AS A PRECIOUS JEWEL
Lord TO GIVE UP I’D BE A FOOL

You ARE MY ALL IN ALL

Verse 1
TAKING MY SIN, MY CROSS, MY SHAME
RISING AGAIN I BLESS Your NAME

You ARE MY ALL IN ALL

WHEN I FALL DOWN You PICK ME UP
WHEN I AM DRY You FILL MY CUP

You ARE MY ALL IN ALL
