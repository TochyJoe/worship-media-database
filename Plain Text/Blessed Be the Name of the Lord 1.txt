Title: Blessed Be the Name of the Lord 1


Times New Roman

Blessed be the name of the Lord
He is worthy to be praised and adored

So we lift up holy hands in one accord

Singing blessed be the name
Blessed be the name

Blessed be the name of the Lord

Blessed be the named of the Lord
He is worthy to be praised and adored

So we lift up holy hands in one accord

Singing blessed be the name
Blessed be the name

Blessed be the name of the Lord

Blessed be the named of the Lord
He is worthy to be praised and adored

So we lift up holy hands in one accord

Singing blessed be the name
Blessed be the name

Blessed be the name of the Lord
