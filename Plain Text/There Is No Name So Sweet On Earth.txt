Title: There Is No Name So Sweet On Earth


Chorus 1
We love to sing of Christ our King
And hail Him blessed Jesus

For there's no word ear ever heard
So dear, so sweet as Jesus

Verse 1
There is no name so sweet on earth
No name so sweet in heaven

The name before His wondrous birth
To Christ the Savior given

Verse 2
And when He hung upon the tree
They wrote this name above Him

That all might see the reason we
For evermore must love Him

Verse 3
So now upon His Father's throne
Almighty to release us

From sin and pain He ever reigns
The Prince and Savior Jesus

Verse 4
O Jesus, by that matchless name
Thy grace shall fail us never

Today as yesterday the same
Thou art the same forever
