Title: I BELIEVE I CAN FLY


Verse 1
I USED TO THINK THAT I COULD NOT GO ON
AND LIFE WAS NOTHING BUT AN AWEFUL SONG

BUT NOW I KNOW THE MEANING OF TRUE LOVE

I’M LEANING ON THE
EVERLASTING ARMS

IF I CAN SEE IT, THEN I CAN DO IT
IF I JUST BELIEVE IT, THERE’S NOTHING TO IT

Chorus 1
I BELIEVE I CAN FLY
I BELIEVE I CAN TOUCH THE SKY

I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY
NIGTH AND DAY

SPREAD MY WINGS AND FLY AWAY

I BELIEVE I CAN SOAR
I SEE ME RUNNING

THROUGH THAT OPEN DOOR
I BELEVE I CAN FLY

Verse 2
SEE I WAS ON THE VERGE OF BREAKING DOWN
SOMETIMES THE SILENCE CAN SEEM SO LOUD

THERE ARE MIRACLES IN LIFE I MUST ACHIEVE

BUT FIRST IT GOT TO START INSIDE OF ME
IF I CAN SEE IT, THEN I CAN DO IT

IF I JUST BELIEVE IT, THERE’S NOTHING TO IT

Verse 3
IF I CAN SEE IT
THEN I CAN DO IT

IF I JUST BELIEVE IT
THERE’S NOTHING

TO IT

Verse 4
I CAN FLY
I CAN DO ANYTHING

YEAH YEAH
I CAN FLY

(REPEAT)

Verse 5
ANYTHING I WANTED TO DO
I CAN DO IT

ANYTHING I WANTED TO DO
FLY FLY FLY!!
