Title: I Know A God Who Is Merciful and Kind


I know a God who is merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious

Am the apple of his eyes
The thoughts that fills his heart

Every morning, moon and night

He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient till I came

Running back into his arms

SEE HOW HE HAS TURNED MY LIFE AROUND
MADE ME A SHINING STAR

HIS GLORY TO REVEAL

Chorus 1


I will worship him forever
Love him forever because

This God is too good oh

This God is too good oh

Jesus you're too good o
This grace is too much

This love is so deep

Don't look too for to see
How good He is, Just look at me

He took me from the miry clay
Set my feet upon the rock

Am standing in his righteousness
O He took away my sin and shame

Give me a brand new name, His beloved
And the redeemed

You are my strength (Hope, Joy, Peace)
Strength like no other

Strenght like no other
Reaches to me

In the fullness of Your grace
In the power of Your name

You lift me up, You lift me up
