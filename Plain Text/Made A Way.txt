Title: Made A Way


Made a way
Don't know how but You did it

Made a way
Standing here not knowing how we'll get through this test

But holding onto faith You know best
Nothing can catch You by surprise

You've got this figured out and you're watching us now
But when it looks as if we can't win

You wrap us in Your arm and step in
And everything we need You supply

You got this in control
And now we know that

You made a way
When our backs were against the wall

And it looked as if it was over
You made a way

And we're standing here
Only because You made a way

You made a way

Now we're here
Looking back on where we come from

Because of You and nothing we've done
To deserve the love and mercy you've shown

But Your grace was strong enough to pick us up

And You made a way
When our backs were against the wall

And it looked as if it was over
You made a way

And we're standing here
Only because You made a way

You move mountains
You cause walls to fall

With Your power
You perform miracles

There is nothing that's impossible
And we're standing here

Only because You made a way

You made a way

Don't know how but You did it
Made a way

Don't know how but You did it
Made a way

Don't know how but You did it

Don't know why but I'm grateful

Don't know how but I'm grateful

And we're standing here
Only because You made

And we're standing here
Only because You made a way

And we're standing here
Only because You made

You move mountain

You cause walls to fall

You cause chains to break

Giants fall

'Cause You move mountain
You move mountain

And everything is easy for You
'Cause You move mountain

Yes You move mountain

Mountains are moving

Strong holds are breaking

'Cause You move mountain
You cause walls to fall

With Your power

You perform miracles
