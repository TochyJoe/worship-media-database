Title: Lord Arise and Take Your Place


Lord arise and take Your place
Be enthroned come fill this space

As we worship and seek Your face
Show Your glory Your power and grace

King of kings and Lord of lords
It is You that we adore

In Your presence is fullness of joy
And we find pleasures forevermore

Hosanna in the highest
