Title: I Sing To You, I Dance With You,


I sing to You, I dance with You
I cry before You here in this place

I give my all, just to be hold
Just to be near, here in this place

Just You and me, everything's so clear
Now I am free, just You and me

Don't care who sees, I don't care who hears
Oh, how I love this place of worship

(Oh God, I long to be with You
More than anything, Lord.)

Oh, how I love this place with You

Free to dance with You, free to sing to You
Free to hear from You. When I'm with You I am

Free to worship, free to bow down
Free... to cry out. When I'm with You I am

Free... When I'm with You I am
