Title: When We Get To Heaven


When we get to heaven
I know I'll see Jesus

Paul and Silas and Abraham
The whole of them would be there

Many many questions I want to ask
Many many things I want to say

First of all I will go to him and say
Thank You Jesus

Onye nwe anyi imela

Nma nma Jesus onye ebere
