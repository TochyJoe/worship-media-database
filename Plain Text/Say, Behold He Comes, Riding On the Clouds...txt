Title: Say, Behold He Comes, Riding On the Clouds..


Say, behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun at the trumpet's call

Lift Your voice, (it's) the year of Jubilee
Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes

Behold He comes, riding on the clouds
Shining like the sun at the trumpet's call

Lift Your voice, (it's) the year of Jubilee
Out of Zion's hill, salvation comes
