Title: HOME IS REALLY WHERE THE HEART


HOME IS REALLY WHERE THE HEART  IS
THEN HOME MUST BE A PLACE, THAT WE ALL SHARE

FOR EVEN WITH OUR DIFFERENCE

OUR HEARTS ARE MUCH THE SAME
AND WHERE LOVE IS

WE COME TOGETHER THERE

WHEREVER THERE IS LAUGHTER RINGING
SOMEONE SMILING, SOMEONE SINGING

WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER THERE

LOVE WILL BE OUR HOME
WHERE THERE ARE WORDS OF KINDNESS SPOKEN

WHERE A VOW IS NEVER BROKEN

WE CAN LIVE TOGETHER THERE
LOVE WILL BE OUR HOME

COUNT ON ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN
A FRIENDSHIP THAT WILL NEVER END

WHEN You ARE WEAK, I WILL BE STRONG

HELPING You TO CARRY ON
CALL ON ME I WILL BE THERE

DON'T BE AFRAID
PLEASE BELIEVE ME WHEN I SAY

COUNT ON

AND I WILL ALWAYS LOVE You X 2
