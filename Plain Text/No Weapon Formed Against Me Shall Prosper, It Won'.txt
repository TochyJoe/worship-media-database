Title: No Weapon Formed Against Me Shall Prosper, It Won'


No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work

Say no weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work
Say no weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work

God will do what He said He would do
He will stand by His word

And He will come through

God will do what He said He would do
He will stand by His word

And He will come through

No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, it won't  work

God will do what He said He would do
He's not a man that He should lie (Stand by his word)

He will come through
Say God will do what He said He would do
