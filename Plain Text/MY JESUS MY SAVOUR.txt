Title: MY JESUS MY SAVOUR


Verse 1
MY Jesus MY SAVOUR
Lord THERE IS NONE LIKE You

ALL OF MY DAYS I WANT TO PRAISE
THE WONDERS OF Your MIGHTY  WORKS

MY COMFORT MY SHELTER
TOWER OF REFUGE AND STRENGTH

LET EVERY BREATHE
ALL THAT I AM

NEVER CEASE TO WORSHIP You

Verse 1
SHOUT TO THE Lord
ALL THE EARTH LET US SING

POWER AND MAJESTY
PRAISE TO THE KING

MOUNTAINS BOW DOWN
AND THE SEAS WILL ROAR

AT THE SOUND OF Your NAME

I SING FOR JOY AT THE WORKS OF  Your HAND
FOREVER I'LL LOVE You

FOREVER I'LL STAND
NOTHING COMPARES TO THE PROMISE  I HAVE IN You
