Title: I Was there When It Happened


Chorus 1
I was there when it happened
And I ought to know

His Spirit burning in me
Set my heart aglow

So I praise the Lord today

Verse 1
You ask me how I know that Jesus saves me
How I know that all my sins are white as snow

You ask me how I know that He forgave me
Now listen I must tell You how I know

Verse 2
You ask me how I know that He redeemed me
And how I received the peace no gold can buy

How from the guilt and pow'r of sin He saved me
Made me an heir to mansions in the sky

Verse 3
And now as thru the world I go rejoicing
I am telling what a Savior dwells within

How I plunged into the cleansing crimson fountain
And Jesus washed my soul from ev'ry sin
