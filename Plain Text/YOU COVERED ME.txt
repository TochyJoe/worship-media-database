Title: YOU COVERED ME


I don't wanna sing th e latest song
I don't want to percolate the crowd

I just wanna make You smile

I don't care who thinks I'm right or wrong
I don't care who tries to calm me down

I just wanna praise You now

You covered me in the midst of it all
You love me, gave me another chance

You saw my needs when others saw my faults
You forgave me

I don't have to listen for my name
They don't have to walk me down the aisle

I just wanna make You proud
Should I make the hall of fame

Or they save a special seat
I just hope that you'll be pleased

You covered me in the midst of it all
You love me, gave me another chance

You rescued me
I was going to fall, going to fall

You saved me

So in my life
In my life

Be glorified, Be glorified (yeah yeah)

You get the glory
You get the praise

You take the honor
I just want to say....thank You

(I've come back to say)
Thank You

Thank You Lord
Thank You (For everything you've done)

You get the glory
You get the praise

You take the honor
I just want to say....Thank You
