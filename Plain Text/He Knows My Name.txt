Title: He Knows My Name


I have a Maker
He formed my heart

Before even time began
My life was in hand

He knows my name
He knows my every thought

He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call

I have a Father
He calls me his own

He'll never leave me
No matter where I go

[Chorus]

He hears me when I call
He hears me when I call

He hears me when I call (you are my Father and I love you)
He hears me when I call (you are my Father and I love you)

He hears me when I call (you are my Father and I love you)
He hears me when I call (you are my Father and I love you)

He knows my name
He knows my every thought

He sees each tear that falls
And hears me when I call
