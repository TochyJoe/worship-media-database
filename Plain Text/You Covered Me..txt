Title: You Covered Me.


I could've lost my mind wanted to give up so many times  but God was my anchor a consistant way maker yes I'm  grateful God covered me

Well the enemy came against me attacked my body and  my ministry but what God ordains he will maintain yes  I'm grateful he covered me

Chorus 1
You covered me hands of protection all around me if not  for Your grace and Your mercy thank You Lord You  covered me

Bridge 1
I failed so many times but Your love divine You touched  this soul of mine and restored me

You covered me hands of protection around me Your  grace and mercy covered me I could've lost my mind  wanted to quit many times but God what You ordain I'm  a witness You will maintain

You covered me hands of protection around me Your  grace and mercy covered me[repeat]
