Title: NOBODY GREAT


I climbed up to the highest mountain
I looked all around, couldn't find nobody

Went down into the deepest valley
Looked all around down there, couldn't find nobody

I went across the deep blue sea
Couldn't find one to compare

To Your grace, Your love, Your mercy
Nobody greater... nobody greater than You

NOBODY GREAT
NOBODY GREATER THAN You

I SEARCHED ALL OVER COULDN'T FIND NOBODY
I LOOKED HIGH AND LOW

COULDN'T FIND NOBODY
