Title: (Black) My Heart Was Dark With Sin


(Black) My heart was dark with sin
Until the Savior came in

(Red) His precious blood I know
(White) Has washed it white as snow

(Gold) And in His Word I'm told
I'll walk the streets of gold

(Green) To grow in Christ each day
I read the Bible and pray
