Title: I Yearn For You My Lord


I yearn for You my Lord
Nothing and no one

Can fill the void in my heart

Your heart is where
I long to beIn the center of Your will

In the center of Your will

Chorus 1
Take my heart
I surrender all to You

Take my will

None of me but all of You
Take my life

As a sacrifice to You

In the center of Your will
In the center

Of Your will

Verse 1
In You I am secure
Nothing can separate me

From your love oh God

Your will is what I long to do
In the center of Your will

In the center of Your will

Oooh
