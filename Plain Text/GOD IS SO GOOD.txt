Title: GOD IS SO GOOD


Verse 1
HE WALKED WHERE I WALK
HE STOOD WHERE I STAND

HE FELT WHAT I FEEL
HE UNDERSTAND

HE KNOWS MY FRAILTIES
SHARED MY HUMANITY

TEMPTED IN EVERY WAY
YET WITHOUT SIN

Chorus 1
God WITH US
SO CLOSE TO US

God WITH US EMMANUEL !

Verse 2
BORN OF A WICKED RACE
STONED BY THE PREJUDICE

SUFFERING INJUSTICE
YET HE FORGAVE

Verse 3
WEPT FOR MY WASTED YEARS
PAID FOR MY WICKEDNESS

HE DIED IN MY PLACE
THAT I MIGHT LIVE
