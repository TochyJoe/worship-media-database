Title: THESE ARE THE DAYS OF ELIJAH


Verse 1
THESE ARE THE DAYS OF ELIJAH
DECLARING THE WORD OF THE Lord

THESE ARE THE DAYS OF Your SERVANT MOSES
RIGHTEOUSNESS BEING RESTORED

Verse 1
THESE ARE THE DAYS OF GREAT TRIALS
OF FAMINE AND DARKNESS AND SOD

WE ARE THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE DESERT
PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE Lord

Verse 1
BEHOLD HE COMES
RIDING ON THE CLOUDS

SHINING LIKE THE SUN
AT THE TRUMPETS CALL

LIFT Your VOICE
ITS THE YEAR OF JUBILEE

OUT OF ZION HILLS SALVATION COMES

Verse 1
THESE ARE THE DAYS OF EZEKIEL
DRY BONES BECOMING AS FLESH

THESE ARE THE DAYS OF Your SERVANT DAVID
REBUILDING THE TEMPLE OF PRAISE

THESE ARE DAYS OF GREAT HARVEST
THE FIELDS ARE AS RIPE IN THE WORLD

STILL WE ARE THE VOICE OF ONE CRYING IN THE DESERT
PREPARE YE THE WAY OF THE Lord

Chorus 1
THERE’S
NO ONE

LIKE JEHOVAH
