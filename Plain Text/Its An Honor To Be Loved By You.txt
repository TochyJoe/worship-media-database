Title: Its An Honor To Be Loved By You


Separate my heart, to give You praise and glory
I proclaim Your love, its purer than the hollies

I surrender all, it all belongs to You

In You I live and move and have my being oh God
Resurrection Power

I Have found my place in You
Living water…

I draw my strength from You

Chorus 1
Its an Honor to be loved by You
There’s a melody in my heart just for You

All my strength, Joy, Power, I find in You
I give You the praise (the Praise)

You deserve my praise (My Praise)

Bridge 1
I Give You
I Give to You the Praise

I give You the praise (the Praise)
You deserve my praise (My Praise)
