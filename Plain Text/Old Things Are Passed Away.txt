Title: Old Things Are Passed Away


Old things are passed away
I'm a new creation

I live a brand new life
Now I know that I am called

Everything is now in place
Oh oh oho hoo hooo

I'm a newborn
My life was heading to the

High cliff with the speed star

I had an encounter
With the master now

I'm a new born
He's my God He's my king

There's no condemnation oo
I am free from sin and death

Now I live a brand new
Life

Ama ama ama ah ah
Ama new born

Now I have a brand new life
Now I have a brand new mind

Now I have a brand new thought
Everything is pure and clean

My life is full of favor and grace
My assignment is to make disciples

To carry God's word to the nations
And He will see us through

Oh oh

Ama ama ama ah ah Ama ne
