Title: I BELIEVE IN MIRACLES


Creation shows the power of God
There’s glory all around

And those who see must stand in awe
For miracles abound

I believe in miracles
I’ve seen a soul set free

Miraculous the change in one
Redeemed through Calvary

I’ve seen the lily push its way
Up through the stubborn sod

I believe in miracles
For I believe in God!

The Love of God! Oh power divine!
Tis wonderful to see

The miracles that He has wrought
Should lead to Calvary
