Title: God of All Living


God of all living
Father, we praise you

Full of thanksgiving
For so much love

Now in this wedding
Come down among us

Pour out Your blessing
Heavenly Dove

Perfect companion
God's gift in marriage

One true communion
Help on life's way

May we be mindful
In need and plenty

May we be faithful
Every new day

With love's true splendour
Father, delight us

Each giving honour
With faithfulness

And may the sharing
Of this sweet union

Deepen our caring
With tenderness

May there be children
Fruit of our loving

True men and women
With faith beside

Grant us Your keeping
In all our future

Your love caressing
Bridegroom and bride
