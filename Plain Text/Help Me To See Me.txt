Title: Help Me To See Me


Help me to see me
The way You see me

Sometimes I see pain Lord
When You see victory

I see where I am Lord
You see where I shall be

Open my eyes, help me believe
I am what You see

(Repeat)

You see me victorious
You see me faithful

You see me believing

That You are able
You see me rejoicing

Cause I have survived

Open my eyes
Help me believe

I am what You see

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh

(repeat)

I am healed

I am free

I  AM STRONG

I AM BLESSED

I AM RICH

I am what You see

IT IS WELL
WITH MY SOUL
