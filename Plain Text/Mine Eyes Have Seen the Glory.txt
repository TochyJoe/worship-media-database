Title: Mine Eyes Have Seen the Glory


Verse 1
Mine eyes have seen the glory of
The coming of the Lord

He is trampling out the vintage
Where the grapes of wrath are stored

He hath loosed the fateful lightning
Of His terrible swift sword:

His truth is marching on

Chorus 1
Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
His truth is marching on

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
Glory, glory, hallelujah!

Glory, glory, hallelujah!
THE CHURCH is marching on

I have seen Him in the watch-fires
Of a hundred circling camps

They have builded Him an altar
In the evening dews and damps

I can read His righteous sentence
By the dim and flaring lamps:

His day is marching on

Verse 1
His day is marching on
I have read a fiery gospel

Writ in burnished rows of steel:

"As ye deal with my contemners
So with You my grace shall deal"

Let the Hero, born of woman
Crush the serpent with his heel

Since God is marching on

Verse 1
Since God is marching on
He has sounded forth the

Trumpet that shall never
Call retreat;He is sifting

Out the hearts of men before
His judgment-seat:

Oh, be swift, my soul, to answer Him!
Be jubilant, my feet!

Our God is marching on

Verse 1
Our God is marching on
In the beauty of the lilies

Christ was born across the sea
With a glory in His bosom that

Transfigures You and me

As He died to make men holy
Let us die to make men free*

[12]While God is marching on

Verse 1
While God is marching on
He is coming like the glory of

The morning on the wave
He is Wisdom to the mighty

He is Succour to the brave
So the world shall be His footstool

And the soul of wrong His slave
Our God is marching on
