Title: SHINE JESUS SHINE 3


Lord, the light of Your love is shining
In the midst of the darkness, shining

Jesus, light of the world, shine upon us
Set us free by the truth You now bring us

Shine on me, shine on me

Shine, jesus, shine
Fill this land with the father's glory

Blaze, spirit, blaze
Set our hearts on fire

Flow, river, flow
Flood the nations with grace and mercy

Send forth Your word
Lord, and let there be light

Lord, i come to Your awesome presence
From the shadows into Your radiance

By the blood i may enter Your brightness
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness

Shine on me, shine on me

As we gaze on Your kingly brightness
So our faces display Your likeness

Ever chaning from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story

Shine on me, shine on me
