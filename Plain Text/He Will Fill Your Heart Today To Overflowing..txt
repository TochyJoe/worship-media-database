Title: He Will Fill Your Heart Today To Overflowing.


Are You longing for the fullness
Of the blessing of the Lord

In Your heart and life today?
Claim the promise of Your Father

Come according to His Word
In the blessèd, old time way

He will fill Your heart today to overflowing
As the Lord commandeth you

Bring Your vessels, not a few
He will fill Your heart today to overflowing

With the Holy Ghost and power

Bring Your empty earthen vessels
Clean through Jesus’ precious blood

Come, ye needy, one and all
And in human consecration

Wait before the throne of God
Till the Holy Ghost shall fall

Like the cruse of oil unfailing
Is His grace forevermore

And His love unchanging still
And according to His promise

With the Holy Ghost and power
He will every vessel fill
