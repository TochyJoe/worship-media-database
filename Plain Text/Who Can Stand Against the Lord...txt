Title: Who Can Stand Against the Lord..


Who can stand against the Lord
No one can

No one will

Who can stand against the king
No one can

No one will

OH! OH!! OH!!
Victory belongs to Jesus

Victory belongs to Him

We put our trust in You
We put our hope in You

You will deliver, you're a provider
I find my victory in You

Forever victorious, forever we win
I find my victory in You

Victory belongs to Jesus
Victory belongs to Him

Victory belongs to Jesus
Victory belongs to Him
