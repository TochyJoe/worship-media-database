Title: You Are Beautiful Beyond Description.


You are beautiful beyond description
Too marvelous for words

To wonderful for comprehension
Like nothing ever seen or heard

Who can grasp Your infinite wisdom?

Who can fathom the debts of Your love?
You are beautiful beyond description

Majesty enthroned on high

I stand; I stand in awe of You
Holy God to whom all praise is due

Lord I stand in awe of You
