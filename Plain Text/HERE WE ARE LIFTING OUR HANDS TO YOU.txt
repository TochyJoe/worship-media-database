Title: HERE WE ARE LIFTING OUR HANDS TO YOU


Verse 1
HERE WE ARE
LIFTING OUR HANDS TO You

HERE WE ARE
GIVING You THANKS

FOR ALL You DO

AS WE PRAISE AND
WORSHIP Your HOLY NAME

You ARE HERE
DWELLING WITHIN OUR PRAISE

Verse 1
FOR EVERY ANSWERED PRAYER 
FOR ALWAYS BEING THERE FOR LOVE THAT HEARS US

WHEN WE CALL FOR ARMS THAT LIFT US WHEN WE  FALL

You HAVE ALWAYS BEEN RIGHT BESIDE US LEADING US  ALL ALONG THE WAY WE MADE IT THROUGH BECAUSE  OF You

Verse 1
FOR DAYS WE CANNOT SEE FOR ALL THAT’S YET TO  BE&#11;THE TRIALS WE MAY HAVE TO FACE WHEN WE’LL BE

LEANING ON Your GRACE IT WILL BE Your STRENGTH
THAT SAVES US Your LOVE THAT MAKES US STRONG  AND THROUGH IT ALL WE’LL SING THIS SONG
