You gave me to me great victories
Anointed me with unfailing love

Your help oh God has made me great

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done

With all my heart

You're the One who saved me from my foes
Set my table before them

You give me strength to run the race

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done

For this I praise Your name
With all my heart

You are my rock
You are my strength

You are my rock
I praise You again and again

My Rock
My Strength, My Rock

I Praise You again and again

For this I praise Your name
For all that You have done

For this I praise Your name
With all my heart
