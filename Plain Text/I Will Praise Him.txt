Title: I Will Praise Him


Chorus 1
I will praise Him, I will praise Him
Praise the Lamb for sinners slain

Give Him glory all ye people
For His blood can wash away each stain

Verse 1
When I saw the cleansing fountain
Open wide for all my sin

I obeyed the Spirit's wooing
When He said "Wilt thou be clean?"

Verse 2
Tho' the way seemed straight and narrow
All I claimed was swept away

My ambitions, plans and wishes
At my feet in ashes lay

Verse 3
Then God's fire upon the altar
Of my heart was set aflame

I shall never cease to praise Him
Glory, glory to His name!

Verse 4
Blessed be the name of Jesus!
I'm so glad He took me in

He's forgiven my transgressions
He has cleansed my heart from sin

Verse 5
Glory, glory to the Father!
Glory, glory to the Son!

Glory, glory to the Spirit!
Glory to the Three in One!
