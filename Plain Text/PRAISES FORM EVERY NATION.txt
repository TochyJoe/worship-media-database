Title: PRAISES FORM EVERY NATION


Praise from every nation, songs of adoration
To the God of our salvation, " Hallelujah"

Glad hosannas ringing, one giant choir singing
To the King of kings we're bringing praises from

Every nation praises from every nation, praises from every
Nation

VERSE:
Let every nation,tribe and tongue, sing praises to the

Holy One; Let every creed and every race, lift Jesus higher
With Your praise

BRIDGE:
Our color may be diff'rent, our dialect seem strange

But through the blood of Jesus, we are the same
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
