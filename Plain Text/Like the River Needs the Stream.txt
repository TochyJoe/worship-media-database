Title: Like the River Needs the Stream


1
Like the river needs the stream

Like the grasses need the dew
Like the sailboat needs the wind

Oh Lord! My soul thirst for You

Chorus 1
Oh Lord you're my shelter
And Lord you're my help

Oh Lord you're my anchor

Let me hide in You forever
My soul thirst forever

2
I'm a withered leaf in June

I'm a morning without dew
I'm just lonely after noon

Oh Lord my soul thirsts for You

3
Like a Merchant seeks his gain

Like the desert needs the rain
Fill my heart with You again

Oh Lord my soul thirst for You

Chorus 1
Oh Lord you're my shelter
And Lord you're my help

Oh Lord you're my anchor

Let me hide in You forever
My soul thirst forever

I’m a hungry suckling child

I’m the dried-out River Nile
Through my toil, my tears, my trials

Oh Lord my soul thirsts for You

Oh Lord you're my shelter
...and Lord you're my help

Oh Lord you're my anchor
Let me hide in You forever

My soul thirst for you

5
Like a heavy load to bear

Like a barren woman’s prayer
Hear me Lord I know you’re there

Cause oh Lord my soul thirsts for You

Oh Lord you're my shelter,...Yes you're my help
Lord you're my anchor

Let me hide in You forever
My soul thirst for You

Oh Lord you're my shelter
And Lord you're my help

Oh Lord you're my anchor
Let me hide in You forever

My soul thirst for you
