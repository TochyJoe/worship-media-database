Title: O Holy Night


Verse 1
O holy night
The stars are brightly shining

It is the night of our dear Savior's birth

Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till he appeared and the soul felt it's worth

Verse 1
The thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder brinks a new and glorious morn

Fall on Your knees

Verse 1
O hear the angel voices
O night divine

O night when Christ was born
O night divine

O night, O night divine
