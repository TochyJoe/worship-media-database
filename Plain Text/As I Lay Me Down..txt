Title: As I Lay Me Down.


As I lay me down
Heaven hear me now

I'm lost without a cause
After giving it my all

Winter storms have come
And darkened my sun

After all that I've been through
Who on earth can I turn to?

I look to You
I look to You

After all my strength is gone
In You I can be strong

I look to You
I look to You

And when melodies are gone
In You I hear a song

I look to You

About to lose my breath
There's no more fighting left

Sinking to rise no more
Searching for that open door

And every road that I've taken
Led to my regret

And I don't know if I'm going to make it
Nothing to do but lift my head

I look to You
I look to You

And when all my strength is gone
In You I can be strong

I look to You
I look to You

And when melodies are gone
In You I hear a song

I look to You

My levees are broken
My walls have come

Tumbling down on me

The rain is falling
Defeat is calling

I need You to set me free

Take me far away from the battle
I need You

Shine on me

I look to You
I look to You

After all my strength is gone
In You I can be strong

I look to You
I look to You

And when melodies are gone
In You I hear a song

I look to You
