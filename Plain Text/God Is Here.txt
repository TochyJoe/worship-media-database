Title: God Is Here


There is a sweet anointing in the sanctuary
There is a stillness in the atmosphere

O come lay down the burdens You have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here

He is here, God is here
To break the yoke and lift the heavy burden

He is here, God is here
To heal the hopeless heart and bless the broken

O come lay down the burdens You have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here

Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord

Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord

Speak Lord, speak Lord
Speak Lord, speak Lord

Speak Lord, speak Lord

O come lay down the burdens You have carried
For in the sanctuary God is here
