Title: My Life I Give.....


My hands were made
To worship You

My heart, my King
It beats for You

Oh Lamb
So true

I surrender to You

Chorus 1
My life
(I give)

My love
(I give)

My all
(All)

Verse 2
Your touch
Your kiss

Your grace
To me

Is deeper
Than my soul can see

My purpose it changed
When I called out Your name

[Chorus]

Bridge 1
My past has been erased
With just one touch from You

My clouds
My rain

My pain
Has changed

Your blood has made me new

[Chorus]

(and when)
And When

This world
(has come)

Has come
(to end)

To end

(and paradise)
And par(when I see Your face)adise

(when You call for me father)

With You
(you'll wipe every tear Father) Begins

(and this is what He'll say)
Well done

(you'll say)
You'll say

(when I see)
When I see Your face

[Chorus]

[Pre-Chorus ]

Jesus You are

[Chorus]

Jesus You are

[Chorus]
