Title: It Is Well With My Soul


Chorus 1
It is well, with my soul
It is well

It is well, with my soul

Verse 1
When peace like a river
Attendeth my way

When sorrows
Like sea billows roll

Whatever my lot
Thou hast taught me to say

"It is well
It is well, with my soul."

Verse 2
Though Satan should buffet
Tho' trials should come

Let this blest assurance control
That Christ has regarded

My helpless estate
And hath shed His own blood

For my soul

Verse 3
My sin, O the bliss
Of this glorious tho't

My sin not in part
But the whole

Is nailed to the cross
And I bear it no more

Praise the Lord
Praise the Lord, O my soul!

Verse 4
O, Lord haste the day
When my faith shall be sight

The clouds be rolled back
As a scroll

The trump shall resound
And the Lord shall descend

"Even so" it is well
With my soul
