Title: Nigeria We Hail thee


Nigeria we hail thee
Our own dear native land

Though tribe and tongue may differ
In brotherhood we stand

Nigerians all, and proud to serve
Our sovereign Motherland

Our flag shall be a symbol
That truth and justice reign

In peace or battle honour'd
And this we count as gain

To hand on to our children
A banner without stain

O God of all creation
Grant this our one request

Help us to build a nation
Where no man is oppressed

And so with peace and plenty
Nigeria may be blessed
