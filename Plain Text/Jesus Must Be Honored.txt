Title: Jesus Must Be Honored


Jesus must be honored
Must be honored

Must be honored
Jesus must be honored

In my life everyday

I was listening to the radio
When i heard this beautiful song

Saying Jesus must be honored
In my life everyday

Yes indeed i agree that it is good
To honor Jesus Christ

He did for humanity what no
Friend, no brother can do

Many years have come and gone
Since Jesus was crucified

But ww still gather round
Unto him who died for us

There remaineth no more sacrifice
There remaineth no more ritual

What could be bigger than the death
Of the son of God at calvary

In the morning let us honor him
Everytime let us honor my Jesus

Glory glory halleluia
To the lamb on the throne

(Everybody sing)

Jesus must be honored
Must be honored

Must be honored
Jesus must be honored

In my life everyday

This is the message of Jehovah
Unto who are living in the end time

In everything that You do
See that the name of my son is

Glorified

I know You know who i'm talking
'bout, Jesus

Make i hear it again, Jesus
Glory glory halleluia

To the lamb on the throne

(everybody sing)
Jesus must be honored

Must be honored
Must be honored

Jesus must be honored
In my life everyday

Jesus must be honored
Must be honored

Must be honored
Jesus must be honored

In my life everyday

Jesus must be honored
In my life everyday

Jesus must be honored
Must be honored

Must be honored
Jesus must be honored

In my life everyday

(once again)
