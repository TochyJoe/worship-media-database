Title: YOU ARE MY STRENGTH...


Times New Roman
You are my strength, strength like no other. Strength like no other reaches  to me.

In the fullness of  Your Grace, in the power of Your name, You lift me up,  You lift me.

You are my joy, JOY like no other. Strength like no other, reaches to me.

In the fullness of Your grace, in the power  of Your name, You lift me up,  You lift me up.

You are my strength, strength like no other. Strength like no other reaches  to me
