Title: WHEN WALKING BY THE SEA


Verse 1
WHEN WALKING BY THE SEA, COME FOLLOW ME, Jesus CALLED
THEN ALL THROUGH GALILEE

THE SICK AND DISEASED

Verse 1
HE HEALED THEM ALL
Jesus HASN’T CHANGED, HIS POWER IS JUST THE SAME AS WHEN HE  WALKED THE SHORE

THIS God OF YESTERDAY IS STILL THE HEALING Jesus NOW AND EVER  MORE

Verse 1
WHAT A HEALING JESUS, I’VE ALWAYS FOUND IN You
WHAT A HEALING JESUS, You RESTORE, REFRESH AND RENEW

YOU’RE MY HEALING Jesus AND IT’S FOR SUCH A TIME AS THIS
ARISE ON HEALING WINGS, SON OF RIGHTEOUSNESS

Verse 1
THE SPIRIT OF THE Lord NOW IS UPON ME AND
IT’S ANOINTING ME

TO HEAL THE BROKEN HEARTS, OPEN PRISON DOORS, SET ALL THOSE  CAPTIVES FREE

Verse 1
TO COMFORT THEM THAT MOURN AND FILL THEIR LIPS WITH PRAISE, TO  POUR THE OIL OF JOY
THAT THEY MAY BE CALLED THE TREES OF RIGHTEOUSNESS, THE  PLANTING OF THE Lord

IF You BELIEVE You WILL RECEIVE

A FRESH ANOINTING FOR Your BODY AND SOUL

COMPLETE DELIVERANCE FOR BODY AND SOUL
