Title: Be Our Chief Guest, Lord


Be our chief guest, Lord
Lord of all living

Lord of all loving
This wedding day:

Bind us together
In Your sure keeping

So we may never
Wander away

Bless all who have brought us
Up from our childhood

Caring, forgiving
Through the long day:

May the same spirit
Shine in our home, Lord

Lighting our pathway
We humbly pray

Bless all our friends, Lord
Happy and true friends

Laughing or crying
Always the same:

Bright with this friendship
May our own home be

Ready to welcome
All in Your name

Be our chief guest, Lord
Lord of all living

Warm with compassion
Showing the way:

Keep us together

In loving service
Families and friends, Lord

This wedding day
