Title: YOU ARE GOD FROM THE BEGINING


You ARE God FROM BEGINNING TO THE END
THERE'S NO PLACE FOR ARGUEMENT

You ARE God ALL BY YOURSELF

You’ve got times and seasons in Your hands
You called forth light out of darkness

You don’t need a man to be the God You are
But You have chosen to call us Your own

You don’t need a man to be the God You are
By Your mercies You have called us Your own
