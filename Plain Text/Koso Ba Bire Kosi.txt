Title: Koso Ba Bire Kosi


Kosobabire kosi kosi
Kosobabire kosi kosi

La yeyi ati lo run
Kosobabire

Your love is so great
You're merciful and gracious

You redeem my soul
From every destruction

I'll sing Your praise
I'll dance and lift You high

You mean so much to me
There's no one like You
