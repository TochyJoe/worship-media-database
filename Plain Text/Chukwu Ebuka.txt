I woke up one early Morning
I said a prayer, and I read my Bible

As I was on my way to work I saw a crowd

And they were shouting
They were looking at a dead man

Didn’t know what to do
Then I walked close to the dead man

And raised my hands in prayer
As I lift my voice to God

Haleluyah He’s alive today, eh!
