Title: Your Only Son No Sin To Hide


Your only Son no sin to hide
But You have sent Him from Your side

To walk upon this guilty sod
And to become the Lamb of God

Chorus 1
Oh Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God

Oh wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

Verse 2
Your gift of love they crucified
They laughed and scorned Him as He  died

The humble King they named a fraud
And sacrificed the Lamb of God

Chorus 1
Oh Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God

Oh wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God

Verse 3
I was so lost I should have died
But You have brought me to Your side

To be led by Your staff and rod
And to be called a lamb of God

Chorus 1
Oh Lamb of God sweet Lamb of God
I love the holy Lamb of God

Oh wash me in His precious blood
My Jesus Christ the Lamb of God
