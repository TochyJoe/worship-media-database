Title: Angels We Have Heard On High


Chorus 1
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!
Gloria, in excelsis Deo!

Verse 1
Angels we have heard on high
Sweetly singing o'er the plains

And the mountains in reply
Echoing their joyous strains

Verse 2
Shepherds, why this jubilee?
Why Your joyous strains prolong?

Say what may the tidings be
Which inspire Your heav'nly song?

Verse 3
Come to Bethlehem and see
Him whose birth the angels sing

Come adore on bended knee
Christ the Lord, the newborn King

Verse 4
See within a manger laid
Jesus, Lord of heav'n and earth

Mary, Joseph, lend Your aid
With us sing our Savior's birth
