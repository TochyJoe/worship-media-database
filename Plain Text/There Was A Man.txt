Title: There Was A Man


There was a man
Who lost his job

He has no money
And everything seems so bad

Landlord’s knocking
Neighbors’ laughing

People wondering
If he’s gonna make it

Am here to tell You
God never fail

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He’s gonna do whatever he said
Just put Your trust in him

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He will do it
Yes he will do it

See a woman
She has no child

Relations mocking
And she is feeling so bad

The clock is ticking
She’s getting older

Everybody is wondering
Will she have a baby

But one day
The pastor said to her

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He’s gonna do whatever he said
Just put Your trust in him

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He will do it
Yes he will do it

Wipe Your tears and say
He will do it

Don’t You worry
He will do it

Don’t You cry
He will do it

Yeah
Lift Your hands and say

He will do it
Never loose hope

He will do it

He’s a faithful God and he never fail
Lift Your hands and say

He will do it
He’s a mighty God

He never fail

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He’s gonna do whatever he said
Just put Your trust in him

O ga eme
Chukwu ga eme

He will do it
Yes he will do it

For you…
