Title: COME AND FILL YOUR LAMB


Chorus 1
Je -   sus, oh Je  - sus
Come and fill Your lambs

Jesus, oh Je - sus
Come and fill Your lambs

Verse 1
Oh let the Son of God enfold You
With His Spirit and His love

Let Him fill Your heart
And satisfy Your soul

Oh let Him have those things that  hold You
And His Spirit like a dove

Will descend upon Your life
And make You whole

Verse 2
O come and sing this song with  gladness
As Your hearts are filled with joy

Lift Your hands
In sweet surrender to his name

O give Him all Your tears and  sadness
Give him all Your years of pain

And you'll enter into life in Jesus'  name
