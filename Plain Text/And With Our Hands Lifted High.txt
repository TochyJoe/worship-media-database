Title: And With Our Hands Lifted High


Verse 1
And with our hands lifted high
We will worship and sing

And with our hands lifted high
We come before You rejoicing

And with our hands lifted high
To the sky

And the world wonders why
We’ll just tell them

We’re loving our King

Verse 1
Majesty
Worship his majesty

Jesus who died
Now glorified

King of all kings
Majesty

Kingdom authority
Flow from his throne

Unto his own

Verse 1
So exalt lift up on high
The name of Jesus

Magnify
Come glorify

Christ Jesus the king
