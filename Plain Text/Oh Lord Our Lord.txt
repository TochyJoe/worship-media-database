Title: Oh Lord Our Lord


Oh Lord
Our Lord

How excellent
Is Your name

Your name is strength
Your name is power

A strong tower
Makes me say

Oh-ooh
Nobody like You Lord

Nobody like You Lord

Oh-ooh
Nobody like You Lord

Nobody like You Lord

Oh Lord
Our Lord

How excellent
Is Your name

Your name is strength
Your name is power

A strong tower
Makes me say

Oh-ooh
Nobody like You Lord

Nobody like You Lord

You're amazing God
And none can compare

Nobody like You Lord
Nobody like You Lord

And when I consider Your heavens
And the works of Your hands

Nobody like You Lord
Nobody like You Lord

At Your name
Every demon must flee

Its strong enough to fight for me
Nobody like You Lord

Nobody like You Lord

I want it all
On a shelf for me

You're my glory
You're my glory

Nobody like You Lord
Nobody like You Lord
