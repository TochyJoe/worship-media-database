Title: WE BRING UNTO YOU


Verse 1
WE BRING UNTO You OUR GRATITUDE
WE OFFER TO You OUR PRAISE

WE OFFER OUR LIVES A SACRIFICE
AS A TOKEN OUR HEARTS WE RAISE

UNTO You

WE MINISTER UNTO You
You GAVE US WONDERFUL

GARMENTS OF PRAISE
SO WE MINISTER UNTO You

WHO WAS AND WHO IS AND WHO IS TO COME
