Title: Take the Stage Lord


Take the stage Lord
And have Your way

I’m just a vessel
And Nothing more

And when You’re done
Please take Your glory

I’m satisfied, just to see You glorified

Take the stage Lord
And have Your way

I’m Your a vessel
And Nothing more

And when You’re done

Oh Dear Lord
I ask You to take You place

Sink through me

Speak through me
Blow through me

Preach through me

That Your name be glorified
Let the name of Jesus

Alone be glorified

And when You’re done
Please take Your glory

I’m satisfied, just to see You glorified

I’m satisfied, to see Jesus glorified
