Precious name, O how sweet!
Hope of earth and joy of heaven

Take the name of Jesus with you
Child of sorrow and of woe

It will joy and comfort give you
Take it then where'er You go

Take the name of Jesus ever
As a shield from every snare

If temptations round You gather
Breathe that holy name in prayer

O the precious name of Jesus!
How it thrills our souls with joy

When His loving arms receive us
And His songs our tongues employ!

At the name of Jesus bowing
Falling prostrate at His feet

King of kings in heaven we'll crown Him
When our journey is complete
