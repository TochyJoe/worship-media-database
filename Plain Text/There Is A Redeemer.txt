Title: There Is A Redeemer


There is a redeemer
Jesus, god's own son

Precious lamb of god, messiah
Holy one

Thank You oh my Father
For giving us Your son

And leaving Your spirit
Till the work on earth is done

Jesus my redeemer
Name above all names

Precious lamb of god, messiah
Hope for sinners slain

When i stand in glory
I will see his face

There i will serve my king forever
In that holy place
