Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow

No other fount I know
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing but the blood of Jesus

What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

For my pardon, this I see
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

For my cleansing, this my plea
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Nothing can for sin atone
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Naught of good that I have done
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Verse 4
This is all my hope and peace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

This is all my righteousness
Nothing but the blood of Jesus
