Title: Thank You For the Morning


Thank You for the morning
Thank You for the noon day given to me

Given to me
Thank You for the evening

My darkest night You let me see
You shined Your light on me

Your grace and mercy sustained
When I did not have the will to remain

You didn't have to do it but You did
You cha nged my life my past You hid

You did not judge me
You reached out and loved me

And that's why

Chorus 1
I'm grateful for all you've done for me

Chorus 1
Grateful for the time You saved me
When I couldn't see my way

Grateful for the time You changed
My darkness into day

Grateful for the time I felt
Your presence by myself

Grateful for in time of trouble
You are my help

I'm grateful for all you've done for me

Verse 2
Thank You for the sunshine
You rayed into my cloudy day

You showed me the way
Gave my life new meaning

Gave me the will to live again
You are my closest friend

I owe my all to You
I spoke Your will

And You brought me through
You didn't have to do it but You did

Covered my life, my sins You hid
You did not judge me

You reached out and loved me
And that's why

Chorus 1
I'm grateful for all you've done for me

Chorus 2
Grateful for the time You loosed
The shackles on my feet

Grateful for the hour I knew
By faith I'd been set free

Grateful for the time You loved me
When I made mistakes

Now that I'm delivered
In Your joy I shall partake

I'm grateful for all you've done for me

Vamp

Grateful, grateful, grateful
For all you've done for me
