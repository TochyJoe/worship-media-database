Title: Old Things Are Passed Away.


Times New Roman;  Old things are passed away
I'm a new creation

I live a brand new life
Now I know that I am called

Everything is new and plain

Oh oh oho hoo hooo
I'm a newborn

My life was heading to the high cliff with the speed star
I had an encounter with the master now I'm a new born

He's my God He's my king
There's no condemnation oo

I am free from sin and death
Now I live a brand new life

Ama ama ama ah ah
Ama new born

Now I have a brand new life
Now I have a brand new heart

Now I have a brand new life
Everything is pure and clean

My life is full of favor and grace
My assignment is to make new disciples

To carry God's word to the nations

And He will see us through
Oh oh

Ama ama ama ah ah
Ama new born
