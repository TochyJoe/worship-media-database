Title: O Jesus I Have Promised To Serve


Verse 1
O Jesus I have promised to serve Thee to the end
Be Thou forever near me, my Master and my Friend

I shall not fear the battle if Thou art by my side
Nor wander from the pathway if Thou wilt be my Guide

Verse 1
O let me feel Thee near me! The world is ever near
I see the sights that dazzle, the tempting sounds I hear

My foes are ever near me, around me and within
But Jesus, draw Thou nearer, and shield my soul from sin

Verse 1
O let me hear Thee speaking in accents clear and still
Above the storms of passion, the murmurs of self will

O speak to reassure me, to hasten or control
O speak, and make me listen, Thou Guardian of my soul

Verse 1
O Jesus, Thou hast promised to all who follow Thee
That where Thou art in glory there shall Thy servant be

And Jesus, I have promised to serve Thee to the end
O give me grace to follow, my Master and my Friend

Verse 1
O let me see Thy footprints, and in them plant mine own
My hope to follow duly is in Thy strength alone

O guide me, call me, draw me, uphold me to the end
And then in Heaven receive me, my Savior and my Friend
