Title: IMELA IMELA


When I think upon Your goodness
And Your faithfulness each day

I’m convinced it’s not because I am worthy –
To receive the kind of love that You give

But I’m grateful for Your mercy
And I’m grateful for Your grace

And because of how You’ve poured out Yourself
I have come to sing this song out in praise

Imela, Imela
Okaka, Onyekeruwa

Imela, Imela
Eze m Oh

Who am I to sing Your praises?
Who am I to worship You?

It’s Your blood that makes the difference in me
And made a way to enter into Your throne

I could not come near Your presence
I could never sing Your song

But the sacrifice on Calvary’s tree
Is the reason I can cry out today

Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi
Onyene mema

Onyedikagi? Ekene diri gi
Onye nagworia
