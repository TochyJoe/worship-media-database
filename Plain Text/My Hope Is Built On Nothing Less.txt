Title: My Hope Is Built On Nothing Less


Arial Black;  VERSE
My hope is built on nothing less

Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness

I dare not trust the sweetest frame
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name

Verse 1
When darkness veils His lovely face
I rest on His unchanging grace

In every high and stormy gale
My anchor holds within the veil

Verse 1
His oath, His covenant, His blood
Support me in the whelming flood

When all around my soul gives way
He then is all my hope and stay

Chorus 1
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand

All other ground is sinking sand
All other ground is sinking sand

Verse 1
When He shall come with trumpet sound
Oh, may I then in Him be found

In Him, my righteousness, alone
Faultless to stand before the throne
