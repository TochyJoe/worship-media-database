Title: When I Come Into Your Holy Presence


Verse 1
When I come into Your holy presence
When I gaze into Your loveliness

When all things that
Surround me become shadows

In the light of You

Verse 1
When I find the joy
Of reaching Your heart

When Your will becomes
Enthroned in my heart

When all things that
Surround me become shadows

In the light of You
