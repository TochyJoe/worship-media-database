Onise Iyanu
You are the God of awesome wonders

I’ve tasted of Your power

Onise Iyanu
You have shown me so much mercy

Much more than I deserve

My eyes have seen, my ears have heard
The wonders of Your praise

Creation bows in awe of You
And we join to give You praise

The words You speak turns things around
Your outstretched arm

Has lifted me
You took away the chains and colts

That held me bound

Omniscient, Omnipotent
The one who does great things

When I behold the things You do

I just can’t hold back my praise
The words You speak turns things around

Your outstretched arm

Has lifted me
You took away the chains and colts

That held me bound

Hey hey hey hey
Hey hey hey hey
