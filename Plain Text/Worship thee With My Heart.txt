Title: Worship thee With My Heart


Worship thee with my heart
This relationship will never part

With my mouth

I will sing
Praises to (our Lord and King)

Our Lord and King

Chorus 1
Sweeter than anything I know
Sweeter than anything I know

I'm going to tell where ever I go

Sweeter than anything I know

Holy hands we extend
To the matchless King

Our Lord and Friend

From the rising of the sun
To the going down of the same

Your sweet name, I shall always praise

He is the sweetest, thing I know
Sweetest story that's ever been told

And I'll worship him always

He is the sweetest thing I know
Sweetest, No one compares to our Lord

And I worship him always, always!

Sweeter
The Lord is sweeter

Jesus is real
And he's so sweet to me

Sweeter
Sweeter than the sweeter than the  sweeter than the sweetest

Lord is
He is sweeter

I'm going tell the world about
I'm going to tell everybody

Jesus is sweeter than the honeycomb
Sweeter than the honey in the  honeycomb
