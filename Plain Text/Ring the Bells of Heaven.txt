Title: Ring the Bells of Heaven


Chorus 1
Glory! Glory! How the angels sing!
Glory! Glory! How the loud harps ring!

'Tis the ransomed army, like a mighty sea
Pealing forth the anthem of the free

Verse 1
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today

For a soul returning from the wild!
See the Father meets Him out upon the way

Welcoming His weary wand'ring child

Verse 2
Ring the bells of heaven!
There is joy today

For the wand'rer now is reconciled
Yes a soul is rescued from His sinful way

And is born anew a ransomed child

Verse 3
Ring the bells of heaven!
Spread the feast today!

Angels swell the glad triumphant strain!
Tell the joyful tidings

Bear it far away!
For a precious soul is born again
