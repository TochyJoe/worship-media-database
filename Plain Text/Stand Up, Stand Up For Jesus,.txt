Title: Stand Up, Stand Up For Jesus,


Verse 1
Stand up, stand up for Jesus
Ye soldiers of the cross

Lift high his royal banner
It must not suffer loss

From victory unto victory his army shall he lead
Till every foe is vanquished

And Christ is Lord indeed

Verse 1
Stand up, stand up for Jesus
The trumpet call obey

Forth to the mighty conflict
In this his glorious day

Ye that are brave now serve him against unnumbered foes
Let courage rise with danger

And strength to strength oppose

Verse 1
Stand up, stand up for Jesus
Stand in his strength alone

The arm of flesh will fail you
Ye dare not trust Your own

Put on the gospel armor
Each piece put on with prayer

Where duty calls or danger
Be never wanting there

Verse 1
Stand up, stand up for Jesus
The strife will not be long

This day the noise of battle
The next the victor's song

To those who vanquish evil
A crown of life shall be

They with the King of Glory
Shall reign eternally
