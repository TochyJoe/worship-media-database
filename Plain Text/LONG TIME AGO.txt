Title: LONG TIME AGO


Long time ago in bethlehem
So the holy bible say

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today

And man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say

That man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

While shepherds watch their flock by night
They see a bright new shining star

Then hear a choir sing
The music seemed to come from afar

Now joseph and his wife mary
Come to bethleham that night

Then find no place to born the child
Not a single room was in sight

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today

And man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say

That man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

By and by they find a little nook
In a stable all forlorn

And in a manger cold and dark
Mary's little boy was born

Long time ago in bethlehem
So the holy bible say

Mary's boy child Jesus Christ
Was born on christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
A new king born today

And man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

Trumpets sound and angels sing
Listen what they say

That man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day

Hark now hear the angels sing
Listen what they say

That man will live forevermore
Because of christmas day
