Title: There Is A New Song In My Heart Today


There is a new song in my heart today
A song of praise in my mouth today

You’ve added another day unto my day
You’ve added another year, unto my years

You picked me from the mountain clay; You set up on the rock to stand
You turned my life around, You put a new song in my mouth

Hallelujah Hosanna (Eya!)
Hallelujah Hosanna (Eya!)

Chorus:
Jehovah we give You all the glory eh!

(Imela yeh!, Imela yeh!!)
Messiah we give You all the glory eh!

(Imela yeh!, Imela yeh!!)
Jehovah we give You all the glory (Imela yeh!, Imela yeh!!)

Messiah we give You adoration eh! (Imela yeh!, Imela yeh!!)
