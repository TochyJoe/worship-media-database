Title: To God Be the Glory


Chorus 1
Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the earth hear His voice!

Praise the Lord! Praise the Lord!
Let the people rejoice!

O come to the Father
Through Jesus the Son

And give Him the glory
Great things He hath done!

Verse 1
To God be the glory!
Great things He hath done!

So lov'd He the world
That He gave us His Son

Who yielded His life
An atonement for sin

And open'd the lifegate
That all may go in

Verse 2
O perfect redemption, the purchase of blood!
To every believer the promise of God

The vilest offender who truly believes
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives

Verse 3
Great things He hath taught us
Great things He hath done

And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son:
But purer and higher and greater will be

Our wonder, our worship, when Jesus we see!
