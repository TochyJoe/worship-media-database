Title: WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN


Arial Black;  WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMA N
CAN'T KEEP HIS MIND ON NOTHIN' ELSE

HE'D TRADE THE WORLD
FOR THE GOOD THING HE'S FOUND

IF SHE IS BAD, HE CAN'T SEE IT
SHE CAN DO NO WRONG

AND TURN HIS BACK ON HIS BEST FRIEND
IF HE PUTS HER DOWN

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
SPEND HIS VERY LAST DIME

AND TRYING TO HOLD ON TO WHAT HE NEEDS
HE'D GIVE UP ALL HIS COMFORTS

AND SLEEP OUT IN THE RAIN
IF SHE SAID THAT'S THE WAY, IT OUGHT TO BE

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
I GIVE You EVERYTHING I'VE GOT

TRYING TO HOLD ON TO Your PRECIOUS LOVE
AND BABY BABY PLEASE DON'T TREAT ME BAD

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
DEEP DOWN IN HIS SOUL

SHE CAN BRING HIM SUCH MISERY

IF SHE IS PLAYING HIM FOR A FOOL
HE'S THE LAST ONE TO KNOW

LOVING EYES CAN NEVER SEE
YES WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN

I KNOW EXACTLY HOW HE FEELS
'CAUSE BABY, BABY

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
WHEN A MAN, WHEN A MAN

WHEN A MAN LOVES A WOMAN
