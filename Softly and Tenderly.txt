Title: Softly and Tenderly


Chorus 1
Come home, come home
Ye who are weary, come home

Earnestly, tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling, "O sinner, come home!"

Verse 1
Softly and tenderly Jesus is calling
Calling for You and for me

See, on the portals
He's waiting and watching

Watching for You and for me

Verse 2
Why should we tarry
When Jesus is pleading

Pleading for You and for me?
Why should we linger

And heed not His mercies
Mercies for You and for me?

Verse 3
Time is now fleeting
The moments are passing

Passing from You and from me
Shadows are gathering

Death's night is coming
Coming for You and for me

Verse 4
Oh for the wonderful
Love He has promised

Promised for You and for me!
Though we have sinned

He has mercy and pardon
Pardon for You and for me
