Title: I'M TRADING MY SORROWS


CHORUS  1
I'M TRADING MY SORROW

I'M TRADING MY SHAME
I'M LAYING THEM DOWN FOR THE  JOY OF THE Lord

CHORUS  2
I'M TRADING MY SICKNESS

I'M TRADING MY PAIN
I'M LAYING THEM DOWN FOR THE  JOY OF THE Lord

Verse 1
I'M PRESSED BUT NOT CRUSHED  PERSECUTED NOT ABANDONED
STRUCK DOWN BUT NOT  DESTROYED

I'M BLESSED BEYOND THE CURSE  FOR HIS PROMISE WILL ENDURE
AND HIS JOY'S GONNA BE MY  STRENGTH

THOUGH THE SORROW MAY
LAST FOR THE NIGHT

HIS JOY COMES IN THE MORNING

Verse 2
AND WE SAY
YES LORD, YES LORD

YES, YES Lord
YES Lord YES Lord

YES, YES Lord
YES Lord YES Lord

YES, YES Lord
AMEN
