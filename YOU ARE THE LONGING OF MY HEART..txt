Title: YOU ARE THE LONGING OF MY HEART.


Like cold water in the desert
Like the fresh rare scent of spring

Precious is Your love to me
Jesus my Lord and King

You're the healing for the nations
You're the balm for wounded hearts

I bow in adoration
My God how great Thou art

You're the longing of my heart
The desire of my life

You are sweetness to my soul
Jesus my all in all

You are sweetness to my soul
Jesus my all in all

You're the fairest of ten thousands
You're the Darling of my being

You're the precious Jewel of Heaven
I'll love You eternally

Oh! That all men may come to know You
And love You endlessly

Pour Your wondrous grace upon us
Till Christ is all we see

So I praise You and I worship
You mean all the world to me

You're my joy and meditation
And ur praises I'll ever sing

Lord I long to see Your face
How I long to know Your heart

Draw me nearer unto Thee
And evermore
