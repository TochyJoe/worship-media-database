Title: Shine Jesus Shine


Verse 1
Shine Jesus shine
Fill this land with the Father's glory

Blaze, Spirit blaze
Set our hearts on fire

Flow, river flow
Flood the nations with grace and mercy

Send forth Your word
Lord and let there be light

Verse 1
Lord I come to Your awesome presence
From the shadows into Your radiance

By the blood I may enter Your brightness
Search me, try me, consume all my darkness

Shine on me. Shine on me

Verse 1
As we gaze on Your kindly brightness
So our faces display Your likeness

Ever changing from glory to glory
Mirrored here may our lives tell Your story

Shine on me. Shine on me
