I believe there's a God who knows
The path in life and where things should go

That means that even if a door should close
Somewhere out there, there's a window for sure

If we don't get presents that can't be changed
And we've done so much we gotta give it away

(Now that's the kind of blessings that I'm talkin' about)
Trust, believe, expect, no doubt

If You have itty bitty mustard seed faith
Then even mountains gotta get out the way

All I wanna get You really, really to believe
Is that He is faithful, I'm faithful to believe

I believe, I believe, I believe, faithful to believe
I believe, I believe, I believe, faithful to believe

And we speak, He can do anything
Exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think

He is able to turn the tables in my favor
If we're faith, faithful to believe

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah
(I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah)

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah
(I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah)

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe
(I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah)

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah
(I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah)

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah
(I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah)

I believe, yes, yes, I do believe, yeah
(Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes I do believe)

Exceeding abundantly above all we ask or think
