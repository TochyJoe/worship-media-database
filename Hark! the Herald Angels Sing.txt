Title: Hark! the Herald Angels Sing


Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Peace on earth and mercy mild
God and sinners reconciled

Joyful, all ye nations, rise
Join the triumph of the skies

With angelic host proclaim
Christ is born in Bethlehem

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Christ, by highest heaven adored
Christ, the everlasting Lord

Late in time behold him come
Offspring of the Virgin's womb

Hail the Flesh, the God Head see
Hail the incarnate Deity

Pleased as man with man to dwell
Jesus, our Emmanuel!

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King

Hail the Heaven-born Prince of Peace
Hail the Son of Righteousness

Light and life to all He brings
Risen with healing in His wings

Mild He lays His Glory by
Born that man no more may die

Born to raise the sons of earth
Born to give them second birth

Hark! the herald angels sing
Glory to the new-born King
