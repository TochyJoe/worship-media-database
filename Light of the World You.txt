Title: Light of the World You


Light of the world You  step down into darkness
Opened my eyes let me see

Beauty that makes this heart adore You
Hope of a life spent with You

So here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down

Here I am to say that you're my God
You're altogether lovely

Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me

King of all days
Oh so highly exalted

Glorious in Heaven above
Humbly You came to the earth You created

All for loves sake became poor

So here I am to worship
Here I am to bow down

Here I am to say that you're my God
You'er altogether lovely

Altogether worthy
Altogether wonderful to me
