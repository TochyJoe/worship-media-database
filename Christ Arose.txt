Title: Christ Arose


Chorus 1
Up from the grave He arose
With a mighty triumph o'er His foes

He arose a victor
From the dark domain

And He lives forever
With His saints to reign

He arose! He arose!
Hallelujah! Christ arose!

Verse 1
Low in the grave He lay
Jesus my Savior!

Waiting the coming day
Jesus my Lord!

Verse 2
Vainly they watch His bed
Jesus my Savior!

Vainly they seal the dead
Jesus my Lord!

Verse 3
Death cannot keep his prey
Jesus my Savior!

He tore the bars away
Jesus my Lord!
