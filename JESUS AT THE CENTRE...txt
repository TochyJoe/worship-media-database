Title: JESUS AT THE CENTRE..


At the center of it all
It’s You that I see

There is power in Your name
Miracles happen in Your name

As we lift our voice in praise
It’s You that I see

Bridge:
You are bigger

Bigger than d biggest
You are stronger

Stronger than the strongest

You are higher
Higher than the highest

You are greater
Greater than the greatest

Jesus
