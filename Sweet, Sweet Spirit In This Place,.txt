Title: Sweet, Sweet Spirit In This Place,


There's a sweet, sweet Spirit in this place
And I know that it's the Spirit of the Lord

There are sweet expressions on each face
And I know they feel the presence of the Lord

Chorus 1
Sweet Holy Spirit, Sweet heavenly Dove
Stay right here with us, filling us with Your love

And for these blessings we lift our hearts in praise
Without a doubt we'll know that we have been revived

When we shall leave this place

There are blessings You cannot receive
Till You know Him in His fullness and believe

You're the one to profit when You say
"I am going to walk with Jesus all the way."

If You say He saved You from Your sin
Now you're weak, you're bound and cannot enter in

You can make it right if You will yield
You'll enjoy the Holy Spirit that we feel
