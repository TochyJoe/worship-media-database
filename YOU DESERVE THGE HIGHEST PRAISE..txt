Verse 1
We come into his house
With singing

Come into Your presence
With praise

Enter Your gates with
Thankful hearts

We are going to celebrate
All of heavens waiting pow'r

Is on its way
So we shout hallelujah

Lifting to ya
A mighty roar of praise

Chorus 1
You deserve the highest praise
That we can give and more

Lord we give You our praise
'Cause thats what we came here for

(Repeat)

Bridge 1
Everything with in me
Reaches out to You

Your power
Your Majesty

Grace and mercy too

There'll be
Singing and dancing hearts

And voices raised
You have set Your people

Free now the house
Is filled with praise
