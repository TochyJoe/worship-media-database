Title: I HAVE A FATHER


I HAVE A Father
WHO WILL NEVER EVER FAIL ME

Jesus IS MY Father
THAT WILL NEVER EVER FAIL ME

ROCK OF AGES NEVER EVER FAIL

Even though it is so hard to move on
Everybody around me couldn't help

Though they promised but they cannot  meet up

Even them, they have their own secret  pains

I 've been long gone, trusting in man
Though they tried but they fail

But i'm encouraged, no hope is lost
Let me tell You why
