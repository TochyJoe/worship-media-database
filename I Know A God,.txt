Title: I Know A God,


I know a God, who's merciful and kind
Faithful and gracious

I'm the apple of his eyes
And the thought that fills his heart

Every Morning, noon and night

He loved me when I didn't care
And was patient till I came

Running back into his arms
Look how he turned my life around

Made me a shining star

His glory to reveal

I will worship Him forever
Love Him forever because

This God is too good o

Don't look too far to see how good he is
Just look at me

He took me from the miry clay
Set my foot upon the rock

I'm standing in his righteousness
He took away my sin and shame

Gave me a brand new name

His beloved and the redeemed
Look how he turned my life around

Made me a shinning light his glory to reveal

I will worship You forever
Love You forever because

This God is too good oh

I will worship HIM forever
Love HIM forever because

This God is too good oh

This God is too good oh
