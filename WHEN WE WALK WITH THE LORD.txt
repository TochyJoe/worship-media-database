Title: WHEN WE WALK WITH THE LORD


Verse 1
WHEN WE WALK WITH THE Lord
IN THE LIGHT OH HIS WORD

WHAT A GLORY HE SHEDS ON OUR WAY!

WHEN WE DO HIS GOOD WILL
HE ABIDES WITH US STILL

AND WITH ALL WHO WILL TRUST AND OBEY

Verse 1
TRUST AND OBEY
FOR THERE'S NO OTHER WAY

TO BE HAPPY IN JESUS
BUT TO TRUST AND OBEY

Verse 1
Not a burden we bear,&#11;Not a sorrow we share
But our toil He doth richly repay

Not a grief or a loss,&#11;Not a frown or a cross
But is blest if we trust and obey

Verse 1
But we never can prove
The delights of His love

Until all on the alter we lay

For the favour He shows&#11;And the joy He bestows
Are for them who will trust and obey

Verse 1
Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet

Or we'll walk by His side in the way

What He says we will do
Where He sends we will go

Never fear, only trust and obey
