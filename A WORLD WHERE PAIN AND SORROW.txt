Title: A WORLD WHERE PAIN AND SORROW


I PRAY YOU’LL BE OUR EYES
AND WATCH US WHERE WE GO

AND HELP US TO BE WISE
IN TIMES WHEN WE DON’T KNOW

LET THIS BE OUR PRAYER
WHEN WE LOOSE OUR WAY

LEAD US TO A PLACE
GUIDE US WITH Your GRACE

TO A PLACE WHERE
WE’LL BE SAFE

I PRAY WE’LL FIND Your LIGHT
AND HOLD IT IN OUR HEART

STARS GO OUT EACH NIGHT
REMIND US WHERE You ARE

LET THIS BE OUR PRAYER
WHEN SHADOWS FILL OUR DAY

LEAD US TO A PLACE
GUIDE US WITH Your GRACE

GIVE US FAITH SO WE’LL BE SAFE

Verse 1
A WORLD WHERE PAIN AND  SORROW
WILL BE ENDED

AND EVERY THAT’S BROKEN
WILL BE MENDED

AND WE’LL REMEMBER
WE ARE ALL GODS CHILDREN

REACHING OUT TO TOUCH You  REACHING TO THE SKY

Verse 1
WE ASK THAT LIGHT BE KIND
AND WATCH US FROM ABOVE

WE HOPE EACH SOUL WILL FIND
ANOTHER SOUL TO LOVE

LET THIS BE OUR PRAYER
JUST LIKE EVERY CHILD

NEEDS TO FIND A PLACE
GUIDE US WITH Your GRACE

GIVE US FAITH SO WE’LL BE SAFE
